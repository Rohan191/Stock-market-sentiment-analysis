This repository contains the dataset, sentiment dictionary and some code used in the project for Sentiment Analysis of News Articles for Stock Market.

Abstract:
\n  In this paper we have used sentiment analysis on news articles to see its effect on stock prices. We collected our dataset using Bing API which gave us links to news articles about a specific company. As no pre-existing sentiment dictionary specifically for stock articles exited, we created a specialized sentiment dictionary only meant to analyze stock articles. Two different machine learning algorithms were applied to the dataset and the accuracy of the two was compared. In order to test our results we attached an overall sentiment to each article in our data set which was compared to the predicted sentiment by the algorithm. We also compared the predicted results with the actual change in the stock prices on the market.
