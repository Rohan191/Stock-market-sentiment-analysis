Separately, the Centre raised R4,000 crore via the CPSE exchange-traded fund (ETF) with the issue getting oversubscribed on Friday. After the Axis Bank deal and the CPSE ETF, proceeds from disinvestment have exceeded the FY14 revised estimates by about R3,800 crore as on Friday. The revised estimate from stake sale in PSUs and residual stake sale in non-government companies was R19,027 crore, and by Friday evening, the government had earned R22,856 crore. However, government sources told FE that the Centre will refund any amount above R3,000 crore from the CPSE ETF, which comprises scrips of 10 state-owned companies, namely ONGC, Coal India, GAIL, REC, Oil India, Container Corp, Power Finance Corp, Indian Oil, Engineers India and Bharat Electronics. “So far, we have received about R4,000 crore. But we have a provision for this ETF where we will have to refund any amount over R3,000 crore. Hence, we will refund the balance amount,” a finance ministry official said. The government sold 4.22 crore shares in Axis Bank — the third largest private sector lender by assets — held by various schemes of the SUUTI via the block trading facility on stock exchanges at an average price of R1,315.193 per share. “There was massive participation from foreign institutional investors (FIIs) in the Axis Bank deal. This includes the likes of global long-only funds who have tremendous faith in the fundamentals on the bank,” a person familiar with the deal said on conditions of anonymity.

India, the second biggest consumer of gold after China, last year imposed a record 10 per cent import duty on the metal and said a fifth of all shipments should be re-exported as finished product to help narrow its current account deficit (CAD). But the recent easing of the CAD has given Finance Minister P Chidambaram and the head of the central bank, Raghuram Rajan, the space to consider lifting the restrictions on gold. “I think what we have to do is slowly and steadily take actions to remove some of these curbs,” Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan told analysts on Wednesday. Timing of any action will be discussed with the government, he said. Premiums fell 85 per cent to $25 to $30 an ounce to London prices on Wednesday, and industry officials on Thursday said premiums would fall further with any easing of the rules. “Premiums will come back to normal, it may range between $1 to $2 an ounce,” said Bachhraj Bamalwa, director with All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation (GJF). “People who have been on the sidelines due to high premiums will come back into the market.” he mentioned. Bullion prices in India hit a record of $160 an ounce to London prices in December of last year. GJF’s Bamalwa said the government could lower the amount of gold that had to be re-exported to increase supplies in the domestic market.

The tariff value is revised on a fortnightly basis after analysing the global price trend. Gold is the second largest import item for India after petroleum. The government had taken several measures to curb gold shipments to address the high current account deficit. These measures include raising the import duty to 10 per cent on the metal and also made it mandatory for traders to export 20 per cent of the imported gold, thereby creating supply crunch in the domestic market. According to the jewellers body, total gold imports are expected to be not more than 550 tonnes this fiscal due to these restrictions, from 845 tonnes in the last fiscal.

Also, the import tariff value—the base price at which customs duty is determined to prevent under-invoicing—in case of silver has been reduced to $644 per kilogram from $694 per kilogram earlier, a notification by the Central Board of Excise and Customs said. The tariff value is revised on a fortnightly basis after analyzing the global price trend. Gold is the second largest import item for India after petroleum. The government had taken several measures to curb gold shipments to address the high current account deficit (CAD). These measures include raising the import duty to 10% on the metal and also made it mandatory for traders to export 20% of the imported gold, thereby creating supply crunch in the domestic market. According to the jewellers body, total gold imports are expected to be not more than 550 tonnes this fiscal due to these restrictions, from 845 tonnes in the last fiscal. The commerce ministry has asked the finance ministry to relax curbs on gold imports. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed more banks, including Axis Bank and Kotak Mahindra Bank, to import gold under the 80:20 scheme, a move seen as a precursor to easing restrictions on inward shipments of the metal.

While the April—February deficit is pegged at 5.3 per cent of GDP, the final print may be a tad lower due to revenue push and expenditure cuts seen in March, the last month of 2013—14 fiscal year, it said. The official data showed yesterday that the fiscal deficit widened to Rs 5,99,299 crore in the April—February period of FY14, or 114.3 per cent of the target. “While the revenue push in March could result in the FY14 full—year deficit coming in a tad lower at 5—5.1 per cent of GDP,” Citigroup said in a research note, adding that the new government’s budget would be a key factor to watch. Fiscal Deficit in April—February stood at 5.3 per cent of GDP, well above the government’s estimate of 4.6 per cent of GDP stated in the Interim Budget. The increase can largely be attributed to both slower revenue growth and higher expenditure growth. After taking over as Finance Minister in August 2012, Chidambaram had drawn up a financial consolidation road map to lower the fiscal deficit to 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2013—14, 4.2 per cent in 2014—15 and 3.6 per cent in 2015—16. The Citigroup report further said that although the government may not fully achieve its FY14 divestment targets, the recent stake sale in SUUTI holdings (Axis bank Rs 5500 crore) and successful introduction of CPSE ETF (about Rs 4200 crore) augurs well for subsequent years.",Average

Emphasising that the economy today is far more stable and far stronger than what it was 20 months ago, he said, CAD is expected to come down about USD 35 billion during the current fiscal. It was at a record high of USD 88.2 billion or 4.8 per cent of GDP as gold imports soared 845 tonnes last fiscal. In order to restrict CAD, the government took measures to curb gold import. The government raised import duty on the precious metal three times taking it to 10 per cent and also made it mandatory to export 20 per cent of the total gold imported. Following this gold imports came down to 19 tonnes in November from a peak of 162 tonnes in May. The CAD, too, was brought down to 3.1 per cent in April-September of current fiscal, from 4.5 per cent in the same period last year. Gold imports have fallen substantially after the restrictions.

They and the bank ...",2014-03-20T07:50:02Z,"India has allowed five domestic private sector banks to import gold, in what industry officials say could be a significant step towards easing of tough curbs on the metal imposed last year to cut the country’s trade deficit. The move could boost gold supplies and bring down premiums for the metal in the world’s second-biggest consumer after China. India’s central bank has allowed gold imports by HDFC Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Indus Ind Bank and Yes Bank, officials at the respective banks told Reuters. Two industry sources confirmed the names of the banks. They and the bank officials did not want to be named as they are not authorised to speak to media. India enforced the so-called 80/20 rule in July, making it mandatory to export a fifth of all gold imports. Under that rule, only six banks and three state-run trading agencies that had facilitated export of gold or jewellery in the past three years were allowed to import. The six banks were mostly state-run lenders. The Reserve Bank of India — the central bank — has now permitted gold imports within prescribed limits by the private banks even though they had not facilitated any exports of metal or jewellery in the past three years. “They have decided upon limits on quantities depending upon the number of (current) customers you have for exports,” said Shekhar Bhandari, executive vice-president of Kotak Mahindra Bank. The Reserve Bank of India did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The move to allow more banks to import gold may raise shipments to about 40 tonnes per month from more than 20 in February, industry officials said. India used to ship in as much 70 tonnes per month, the biggest import after oil that had pushed the current account deficit (CAD) to a record high in the year ended March 2013. “Supplies will be smooth from now and I think premiums will come down,” said Haresh Soni, chairman of the All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation. “This looks like just a beginning to the further easing of 80/20 rule.” India used to be the No. 1 buyer of gold before the levy of a record 10 per cent import tax in stages and other restrictions led to a sharp cut. Premiums hit a record of $160 an ounce in December, triggering smuggling and forcing industry officials to call for a repeal of the curbs. Further major relaxations of the curbs are likely only after a new government is formed around June, officials involved with policy making said.",Positive

Right from the initial trade, we observed immense buying interest among market participants, which resulted in a rally of nearly one-and-a-half per cent on Nifty; the index ended the session at the highest point of the day. The bulls maintained their optimism for the rest of the week, ignoring unfavourable global developments. In this process, our markets managed to conquer all intermediate resistance levels and closed at the highest point of the week. On a weekly basis, the capital goods, banking, PSU and oil & gas counters propelled the rally; whereas defensive sectors like IT and healthcare trimmed further to close on the losing side. Sensex and Nifty ended the week with sizable gains of 2.69 per cent and 3.09 per cent, respectively, over the previous week's closing. The '89-day exponential moving average' and the '89-week exponential moving average' are placed at 21,046/6,265 and 19,714/5,903 levels, respectively. The '20-day exponential moving average' and the '20-week exponential moving average' are placed at 21,761/6,493 and 21,061/6,272 levels, respectively. All the five sessions of the just-concluded week ended in the positive territory as the bulls were unwilling to leave their driving seat. On the first day of the week, Nifty witnessed a breakout from its nine-day-long congestion zone and as expected, moved beyond the 161 per cent Fibonacci retracement level (calculated from 6,355.60 to 5,933.30) of 6,620 to reach the initial target of 6,700. The optimism was so strong that our market even overlooked the derivative expiry session and gave a genuine up move, barring the last half an hour of the session. Nifty has now closed at a record high and is almost on the verge of confirming a monthly 'Horizontal Line' breakout. This breakout gives much higher targets and hence, we reiterate that it has become a buy-on-dip market, considering 4-6 months' time horizon. But from a near-term perspective, we continue to mention 6,750-6,800 levels, which are one-and-a-half per cent away from the current level. We may not have a proper trade set in the index and hence, we advise traders to shift their focus on stock-specific moves. On the flip side, 6,643 - 6,575 levels would now act as immediate support levels for the index. Nifty spot closed at 6,695.90 this week, against a close of 6,494.90 last week. The put-call ratio has decreased from 1.03 to 0.87 level and the annualised cost of carry is positive 6.61%. The Open Interest of Nifty futures decreased by 27 per cent. PCR-OI has decreased from 1.03 to 0.87 last week. This ratio has mainly decreased due to significant buildup in call options. In call options, huge buildup was seen the 6,700-7,100 range, while in put options significant buildup was seen in the 6,400-6,700 strike range. The maximum build-up is currently accumulated at 6,700 call and 6,400 put of this series. Total open interest of the market has decreased from Rs 1,74,182 crore to Rs 1,18,964 crore. Stock futures open interest has decreased from Rs 40,034 crore to Rs 35,964 crore. Largecap names which added significant positions last week are PNB, Cairn, Hindalco, Reliance and DLF. On the other hand unwinding was visible in counters like HeroMotoCorp, Tata Motors, Sun Pharma, M&M and Infosys. The implied volatility (IV) for Nifty has increased from 13.02 per cent to 15.44 per cent. Historical volatility (HV) is at 14.43 per cent and that for Bank Nifty is trading at 28.97 per cent.

The country’s third-largest private bank is planning to target the 2.5 crore households who draw income of less than Rs 25,000 per month. At present, the size of the housing finance segment in India is estimated at Rs 7 lakh crore worth of oustandings. But most players tend to focus on customers whose monthly income is above Rs 25,000 per month. Jairam Sridharan, head of consumer lending and payments at Axis Bank, said one of the key attractions of the new product was that it would give loans for amounts as low as Rs 1 lakh and up to Rs 15 lakh in small towns (population less 10 lakh) and up to Rs 25 lakh in larger towns where the population is over 10 lakh. Further, the equated monthly instalment (EMI) will be spread over a period of 30 years, which will put a stress-free repayment burden on the customer. The lender will extend finance for a house of even 325 square feet. Most home loan financiers stipulate that the house size should be at least 600 square feet. The Asha Home Loans product design and structure is the outcome of an extensive research conducted by the bank on the lower income customers in India. These loans are meant for customers with family incomes of Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 per month and above. Moreover, the customers can pool their family income instead of depending on an individual. The Asha Home Loan, which is available to both salaried and self-employed individuals, can be taken in both floating and fixed rate options. It also entails simple documentation.

The move could boost gold supplies and bring down premiums for the metal in the world's second-biggest consumer after China. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed gold imports by HDFC Bank (NSI:HDFCBANK.NS - News), Axis Bank (NSI:AXISBANK.NS - News), Kotak Mahindra Bank (NSI:KOTAKBANK.NS - News), IndusInd Bank (NSI:INDUSINDBK) and Yes Bank (NSI:YESBANK.NS - News), officials at the respective banks told Reuters. Two industry sources confirmed the names of the banks. They and the bank officials did not want to be named as they are not authorised to speak to media. India enforced the so-called 80/20 rule in July, making it mandatory to export a fifth of all gold imports. Under that rule, only six banks and three state-run trading agencies that had facilitated export of gold or jewellery in the past three years were allowed to import. The six banks were mostly state-run lenders. The RBI has now permitted gold imports within prescribed limits by the private banks even though they had not facilitated any exports of metal or jewellery in the past three years. ""They have decided upon limits on quantities depending upon the number of (current) customers you have for exports,"" said Shekhar Bhandari, executive vice-president of Kotak Mahindra Bank. The RBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The move to allow more banks to import gold may raise shipments to about 40 tonnes per month from more than 20 in February, industry officials said. India used to ship in as much 70 tonnes per month, the biggest import after oil that had pushed the current account deficit (CAD) to a record high in the year ended March 2013. ""Supplies will be smooth from now and I think premiums will come down,"" said Haresh Soni, chairman of the All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation. ""This looks like just a beginning to the further easing of 80/20 rule.""",Positive
