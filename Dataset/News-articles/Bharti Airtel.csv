According to a report by brokerage firm CLSA, there is regulatory clarity after the recent spectrum auction wins, and despite higher payments and capex, its hefty cashflow should enable balance sheet improvements. India’s broadband penetration is only 2 per cent, while mobile is a vast 72 per cent (893 million subscribers) and rising. Bharti, the nation’s top mobile operator, is taking the lead in data ramp up and, with the largest network and highest spectrum, the agency said. “…we expect its mobile-data subscribers to jump 2.4 times to 129 million by FY17. Mobile data ramp up along with an upturn in voice revenue per minute should drive a 5 per cent annual improvement in average revenue per user (ARPU),” it added. According to CLSA, Bharti Airtel is the “best play” on this theme as it has the broadest data spectrum footprint, the widest network infrastructure and a strong incumbency advantage. Data will contribute 50 per cent of incremental mobile revenue over FY14-17 (cumulative), boosting EBITDA to a 12 per cent per annum, it said, adding the company’s balance sheet is improving and sector consolidation will be an added opportunity. Just as the absence of last mile connectivity led to India skipping the fixed-line phase and moving to 893 million mobiles phones over the past decade, the market is now set to leapfrog from PC-based fixed-line Internet access and adopt mobile data.

Telecom companies are expected to report flat realisation per minute (RPM), which determines profitability of a cellular operator, during January-March 2014. Two of the country's top three cellular operators, Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular, which reported steady growth in RPM during the previous three to four quarters, may post less than a one per cent increase in RPM due to slowing economic growth and increased competition from smaller operators, equity analysts point out. But the total minutes of usage (MoU) on their networks are expected to increase in the range of 2.5-5.3 per cent, as rates remained unchanged during the quarter. In a note on listed telecom companies, Goldman Sachs analyst Sachin Salgaokar says Bharti Airtel's revenue was expected to increase by 4.3 per cent, while the company might report a marginal (around one per cent) decline of revenue from its Africa business. Idea Cellular, the country's third-largest mobile operator by subscriber base, is likely to report a 5.3 per cent increase (quarter on quarter) in revenue, notes Salgaokar. ""We expect a marginal increase of up to 0.5 per cent in RPM, while MoU will rise three-five per cent on a sequential basis. The revenue increase will remain in the low single digits. However, Bharti may have some impact in Africa revenues because of rupee appreciation,"" says Ankita Somani, telecom analyst with Angel Broking. Goldman Sachs, in its note, has said both Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular will have a debt impact for the money they had to shell out for acquisition of fresh spectrum at the February auction. ""We expect Bharti to post a forex gain of Rs 90.6 crore in the fourth quarter,"" says Salgaokar. Analysts estimate Bharti Airtel will report an increase in Ebitda (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation), while Idea Cellular may have flat Ebitda during the January-March quarter. ""We estimate Bharti's Ebitda margin to rise 17 basis points quarter on quarter,"" Salgaokar says, adding that Idea Cellular's Ebitda margin will remain flat quarter on quarter at 31 per cent due to higher network expenditure and other expenses. Reliance Communications is also expected to have a flat quarter while there could be smarginal change in MoU, says Somani. ",Negative

""In our view, the companies' main reasons for improving their financial profiles are the weak economy and high interest rates in India, which have adversely affected cash flows and debt-servicing ability. Another reason is companies are refocusing on reducing debt after years of investing significantly on rapid growth."" Standard & Poor's recently revised the outlook on our 'B+' rating on Tata Power Co. Ltd. to positive and raised the rating on Bharti Airtel Ltd. to 'BBB-' after both Indian companies started focusing on lowering debt, in addition to benefiting from favorable regulatory developments. Tata Power announced a rights issue of Indian rupees (INR) 20 billion and a stake sale in a coal mine amounting to about US$500 million. Bharti Airtel also raised US$1.25 billion through equity offering last year and we believe the company would continue to take measures such as sale of stakes in subsidiaries (such as Bharti Infratel Ltd.) or non-core assets (such as tower infrastructure).",Positive

It is expected to capture ...,2014-03-28T07:54:51Z,"CIMB Research has upgraded SingTel to a BUY from a HOLD because it says SingTel's performance is recovering because currencies have stabilised and competition and regulatory risks have been reversed. Growth is expected of the Singapore operations through tiered mobile data plans and fixed broadband adoption. The company has 60% share of the Singapore fibre broadband market. It expects FY15 revenue to be flat. Spectrum will contribute another year of growth but only if there are further cost controls. Advanced Info Services (AIS) is expected to benefit from the 900MHz spectrum auction in the second half of FY14. But this benefit could be larger, if Thailand's National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) combines the 900MHz with a 1,800MHz spectrum as a packaged auction. And if this spectrum auction is successful, the capex cycle for AIS could be extended by one to two years. Besides benefitting from the auction of spectrum, AIS could grow further by managing capex better, cutting costs and making improvements to service standards. Bharti Airtel is believed to be in the best position to seize opportunities in the Indian data market. It currently covers 77% of the Indian urban population for data through its 3G/LTE service and strategic spectrum investments. It is expected to capture incremental revenue market share of 40% during FY15-FY15, compared to 30% in FY12-FY13, because of higher data revenue market share and higher contributions from mobile data. Growth in India will also come from stable voice tariffs, data business expansion, and greater utilisation of its 3G network. Even bigger rewards could come from spectrum auctions because of unexpected interest in spectrum. Its African operations, through Airtel Africa, are expected to recover through data revenue and the Airtel Money service. Airtel Africa's EBITDA is expected to grow because of higher network utilisation at a compound annual growth rate of 11% over FY14-16. If its tower assets in Africa are sold, there could be more upside to performance. CIMB says Globe Telecom faces a new competitor because Smart, a unit of PLDT, has shifted its focus to the prepaid market. Should this continue, Globe with its focus on postpaid services says it can lower costs. Globe has started to cap data usage to prevent bandwidth abuse and has to look further into data monetisation as a result. It is also exploring ways to bill for data by volume rather than time. Telkomsel is doing well with its leadership in 3G that enables it to compete aggressively and monetise the surge in data usage in Indonesia. Its 30% market penetration is highest among telcos in Indonesia and its core net profit is expected to grow 12%-15% in FY14 and FY15. Re-rating catalysts on SingTel are improving earnings and earnings surprises. CIMB Research now has a BUY call with a price target of S$4.05.",Positive

India's Economic Times said earlier on Friday that Bharti Group was in talks with Carrefour and Aeon to set up a joint venture with one of them after the collapse of a similar venture with the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart , last year. ""This is not the case,"" an Aeon spokesman told Reuters, when asked about the report. Both Carrefour and Bharti declined to comment. ""Discussions with Carrefour were at an advanced stage. However, the talks were put on hold due to the entry of Japanese retailer Aeon,"" the Indian paper cited one of two sources familiar with the negotiations as saying. ""Some of the senior officials of Bharti Retail are in favour of tying up with the French major as it has an existing footprint in India's cash and carry space that would be a perfect match for Bharti Retail,"" the source added. Bharti - which is also the parent of Bharti Airtel India's biggest mobile phone carrier - and Wal-Mart broke up their six-year-old joint cash and carry venture in October 2013. The move left Bharti to find another deep-pocketed partner to support its retail expansion. Carrefour, which has five cash and carry stores in India, would fold this business unit into a joint venture with Bharti, the Economic Times said. Carrefour would also invest in back-end support and commercial real estate companies owned by Bharti, it added. Commenting on his plans for India at Carrefour's 2013 earnings conference earlier this week, Chief Executive Georges Plassat told investors: ""We are currently thinking about India. We have a small business in India, it does not bring any losses or gains but the true challenge is to know how we tackle India for the next 20 years."" Describing India as ""a very complex, very challenging country"", Plassat said Carrefour would not expand there ""on our own anyway"". Global foreign firms have long been frustrated in their efforts to set up shop in India due to complex and restrictive retail legislation. In late 2012, the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh opened India's $500 billion (298 billion pounds) retail industry to foreign operators, allowing companies such as Wal-Mart and Tesco to own majority stakes in Indian chains for the first time. However, India left it up to individual states to decide whether or not to allow foreign retailers. So far, fewer than half of India's 28 states have adopted the policy, making it harder for retailers to exploit economies of scale by setting up sourcing and cold storage networks that could serve stores in neighbouring states.",Average
