RIL group president V Balasubramanian on April 2 wrote to the chief election commissioner VS Sampath saying the revision of its eastern offshore KG-D6 gas price was a contractual necessity as the old rate of $4.2 expired on March 31.   To decide on the rate to be effective from April, 2014, the government had in 2012 constituted a committee under Prime Minister's economic advisory council chairman C Rangarajan. Based on the panel's recommendations, the Cabinet in June approved a new pricing formula.   The Cabinet on December 19 again approved the applicability of the formula on KG-D6 fields and the oil ministry notified the formula on January 10 this year.   ""You will appreciate that the said (natural gas pricing) guidelines were notified well before the model code of conduct came into force (in early March),"" he wrote.   Giving a detailed account of how gas prices were set and what methodology was followed in the present case, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) said the Supreme Court is hearing a petition opposing the gas price hike on a day-to-day basis.   ""The Honorouble Supreme Court of India has not granted any injunction or stay on revision of the gas price and as such there is no question of deferring the revised prices of gas on teh basis of the matter being subjudice,"" it said.   The Election Commission on March 24 asked the government to defer implementation of the formula, which would have nearly doubled the rates to $8.3 per million British thermal unit, on grounds that the matter is sub-judice.   ""We trust that what is set forth above would clearly demonstrate the necesity for reconsideration of the decision of the Honourable Election Commission taken on March 24 and we earnestly request you to do so,"" RIL added."

Despite this ...",2014-04-05T09:04:07Z,"With the countdown to the elections having begun, the market has started pricing in the election verdict to a certain extent after witnessing a fairly robust rally aided by some serious flows from global investors.  Although market made new highs in the past few days, it was devoid of whole-hearted participation from retail investors. In an interview with Udayan Mukherjee on CNBC-TV18, Madhu Kela of Reliance Capital said since 2010, most investors bestowed faith in asset classes other than equities. But now, assets like gold have fallen flat and equities have bounced back. Despite this, investors have not returned to equities.  To beat the gloom and pessimism among local investors, a strong government and decisive action are needed, he said. While admitting the current government had swung into action for the last few months, which did help participation, a lot will improve if stability comes at the Centre. He sees the market making sharp upmoves if all goes as planned.  Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:  Q: How have you read this run-up to the elections and what part of the election verdict is in the price already?  A: I think market is certainly in a better mood as compared with what we have been for so many years. The breadth of the market has increased and we are seeing some participation in the sectors which didn’t participate for a long period of time. If opinion polls were to be believed with a real stable government that gets 240-250 plus seats and one can bank on the government that is going to be around for five years then I do not think that what all could happen in India is priced in. I think there would still be a long way to go.  Q: You are in a good position to gauge a local participation as well. In the last few weeks since the market took out its previous top, have you seen participation come back to an extent or are people still saying we will rather watch the election verdict and then take that plunge?  A: I think the smart money maybe the high networth individuals have started to participate a bit, but it’s still a long way to go. We have had one lakh twenty thousand crore rupees of redemptions from mutual funds and insurance companies from April of 2010 till December last year; I do not have the updated number for last two-three months, but I am just saying that in this period also people saved money that got diverted to gold where people have made no money, it got diverted to fixed income investment which barely been able to hedge the inflation and has got invested in property where people have not made money.  So, people have kept selling equities for last three-four years and have kept on investing in other asset classes that have become rather illiquid and as we have seen in the past, once market starts to run and people get this feeling that we are left away, I think the participation could be of a very different nature and size and that certainly not there.  I see small money trickling in from here and there; whatever risk we see even in the B group stocks, if you analyse it deeply, except the top 15-20 liquid names, lot of the stock price rise is on very thin delivery volume. So, it is not reflecting any huge participation from any class of investors.  Q: You said that maybe the market has not fully priced in the election event. If indeed the opinion polls were correct then post the election verdict, how much more upside would you give the Nifty and also the rupee versus dollar which has also started pricing in this outcome?  A: Let me take you back a bit, we have had a five year of very sluggish market environment wherein the index broadly has remained where it was at 2008 level. It has just broken down up by 1,000 points or 1,500 points. But if we see the bipolarity in the market only then we will be able to understand how much more could you go. This one index which is IT, pharmaceutical, fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) maybe that index is at 50,000 and the other index by definition will be at 12,500-13,000 which was substantially higher in 2008. So, there has been a huge correction of 50-60-70 percent in the index as a whole.  So, when we say that we have a stable government, we are expecting that there will be confidence in the mood of industrialist and investors to come and participate, specifically the local people and there are so many outflows which have happened. So, a lot of money could pour into these sectors that have been underperforming for last five years and little bit of impetus from the government and policy forthcoming could completely change the sentiment and just to give credit to this government; I think lot of work has actually happened in the last six-nine months and partially market is even reflecting that mood.  If you have a decisive government at the Centre, which is proactive to economy and to market, there is still a long-long way. Something fell from Rs 100 to Rs 10 and it has gone from Rs 10 to Rs 15, you do not say that it has gone up 50 percent so it is fully priced.  Q: Let me play devil’s advocate and re-phrase the question slightly differently - over the last few weeks if you have conversations with global investors, they will point out that India is actually doing much better in a relative sense compared to its emerging markets. They talk about current account deficit (CAD), consumer price index (CPI) coming down, the rupee has cooled down, now all of this is happening not by the next government which the market is talking about but by the current government. So, why should the markets start to rally and see significant jump in valuations if this government changes into a new government which is an unknown quantity?  A: That is the nature of the market. There was a lot of value, one had the guts to thumb the table and say that for a long-term investor, and maybe this is the right time. So, market always needs an excuse to go up and after it starts going up, it starts attributing reasons why it has gone up. The reasons could be anything. There was virtually no participation from the people and little bit change in the mood that has caused this rally. This also got huge support from the calm international sentiment, basically so much money got printed in world in the last three-four years, part of the money has come and because India is doing well, more and more investors who are underweight on India are compelled to look at India and start to participate.  The nature of buying that I hear is all basket buying from sovereign funds which is why you are seeing that the whole mood changes, not only attributed to this upcoming new government but also partially because the valuation whereby in our side and partially because of the problems in other emerging markets: off late problems in Russia, the ongoing problems in Brazil, the problems in China have found India to be relatively safer given circumstances and the foreign institutional investors (FII) money has poured in.  As you said, being a devil’s advocate, conversely, if you do not have a stable and a good perceived government vis-à-vis market in the economy then I would not be surprised that this whole sentiment will turn again and it could yet again become negative. Therefore, market is certainly hoping in the last two-three months that we will have a more stable, pro-active market forward looking government at the Centre over the next five years.   Q: What would constitute forward looking is my next question to you because we have seen this kind of market movements hinging around election verdicts in the past and they have not always been the most sanguine over the period of time, you will re-call yourself the last United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was met with a 18 percent rally in the index over just two days only to be followed by three-four years of utter frustration. What will convince the market this time that despite its favoured government coming to power on the May 16, we are not going to walk down the same path as we did four-five years back?  A: First and foremost are the absolute numbers. There is a difference between what you can do when you have210 seats and what you can do when you have 250-260 seats.  There is so much money floating around in the world which has not been able to park at one percent interest rate; in countries like Germany, interest rates are still running merely at zero or negative percent, even in the US, the interest rate are absolutely at dismal level. So, any person who comes at the Centre and who can give a strong confidence to international investors that we mean business, we will fix up all our small issues. There is something like goods and services tax (GST) which is been pending for five years, if we assume after the formation of the government, it will be implemented in the next 6-12 months. Now, lot of experts have attributed that can contribute minimum 1-1.5 percent to the economy.  Lot of what was pending has also got done in the last six-nine months which is why you see the mood of the market where it is today. So, market is hoping that the new government which comes in will finish off whatever is unfinished in terms of the agenda and will be able to take few steps that will lead the investors, by and large, whether it is local or foreign investors to believe that we are in the right path and that sentiment given the global markets and given local liquidity, I will not be surprised that even we attract a lot of foreign direct investors (FDI) flows, we attract a lot of debt flows, as you have seen in the last three months little bit of sentiment change and we attracted like Rs 30,000-35,000 crore of debt inflow.  Q: The point that you alluded to earlier, which is the kind of portfolio construct one must have these days because a very different set of stocks has led this pre-election rally. Are you prepared to go down already and buy those stocks which are still trading at 40-50 percent below their 2008 peaks? The stocks which have not moved which are trading in your words at 12000 Sensex or has the time for that not come yet, you would still be higher on the quality ladder and move to those stocks later?  A: If you see the construct of people’s mind in the last five years, majority of the fund managers had become defensive. So even if you have a very defensive bank in your portfolio, very few people were brave hearted to have gone and bought things which are running currently. So the first point is if the change happened for positive then everyone will have to run towards that and change the portfolio mix which is basically reducing your bet on defensives whether it is FMCG, technology or pharmaceutical as that is what has dominated your portfolio and that is where the returns have been for the last five years. It will hence be imperative for people to change.  Question is what do you do now? I think you buy companies which are going to be survivors in the 12500 index which I am alluding to. So if the government is not very positive, you still can find lot of value in the market and these are like bear market survivors for last five-six years. I hate to discuss stocks but let me just for the purpose of argument take something like one of the largest companies in India like Reliance Industries. It has not participated in the last five-six years in any run. No one argues that there is lot of value and the value is not discovered by the market because of the existing uncertainties. So I am saying whether it takes six months or 12-18 months, those uncertainties will go away. And if there is a more stable government at the Centre, may be those uncertainties will go away sooner than what the market is expecting. May be you start to participate in companies like them in order to build a portfolio because if you wait till May 16 and if the mandate is decisively positive, I am afraid it will be too late for you to change your portfolio completely.  Q: Would you go down the ladder right now and buy something like a metal stock or a public sector bank stock because those have started moving in the last few days and they move really fast, 30-40 percent in a week. Are you prepared to take that bet or should that bet come later even if you miss out early gains?  A: I am not prepared to take that bet where I am willing to buy anything where the balance sheet is completed fractured and the business model is yet not on the table which I can believe. So I am not willing to buy any of that. But even in a public sector bank, am I willing to bet one two-three banks? Yes I am willing to bet. But just because PSU banks are running, I will not buy the entire pack and say that it should be 10 percent of my portfolio.  Q: Last year, you spoke about HCL Technologies being one of our big bets. My question is not about HCL Tech specifically, it is about what you do with IT in your portfolio which has served you very good, do you bring down the weightage dramatically, throw it out of your portfolio or do you think this is a period of relative underperformance after which these stocks will generate returns again?  A: In a proper portfolio construct, you never throw IT completely away from your portfolio because like I have 15-16 percent weight on your overall index portfolio today. But certainly, you have to go a little bit underweight. If you have 10 names which are constituting overweight in your portfolio, you certainly sell off two-three names which you believe may not do as well and are very sensitive to currency. You certainly don't throw them but go underweight on IT.   The reason for me to say that you don't completely throw it out is - if the election verdict is other way round and there is a sense of uncertainty then again these will be the same sectors which have done well for last five years. They will come back all over again. Again, it will be so difficult if you are underweight to the extent of 10 percent in IT, it will be virtually impossible to come back and buy those companies 20 percent higher.    Q: What is your gut feeling this time, will the market price in the verdict the way the wind is blowing even before May 16 in which case the market would have rallied significantly more from where we have reached already leaving little valuation room for the market to go up 10 percent immediately after the results? Or do you think there will be a pause and the market will once again respond with a massive move after the election verdict. Of these two probabilities which one has a higher weightage in your mind?   A: This is a little tricky one because if you tell me whether it is 250 or 210 then I can answer that question but I don't know whether it is 220-230 or 250. If it is 250 or 250 plus, then I would say whatever the pause, it’s a clear cut buy on dips market, whatever dips comes is an opportunity and people will have to buy these sectors that are being neglected for a period of time. But if it is somewhat like 210-220 kind of a mandate, then market may pause and a lot of the upside which would have happened because of the strong government at the Centre may have been priced in even before the elections.  Q: Let me talk about the risk because we are now talking only about positive upside and where the market can go on the way up but there are always counterbalances?  A: Absolutely.  Q: Let me start with the global picture. By the time June is done and we are through with election season, what do you see in the second half of the year from a global perspective. Do you see any of those risks between June and December manifesting them in such a way that it can come in the way of a much bigger rally in the second half for our market?  A: Globally, the significant underperformance of emerging market over the last 24 months is a positive for us. You have seen outflow from emerging markets both in the fixed income as well as in equities. So, that has a room to surprise little bit on the positive side.  However, China risk is one probable risk at the back of my mind because of the happenings in the last three-four months. China is certainly not pleasant, certainly not for someone like me; so we will have to watch that closely in spite of their strong balance sheet, huge foreign exchange reserve to defend any short-term; this is a really bad thing that could happen but in the next six-nine months. This is one risk which I will closely monitor that has a big impact on India because we have significant weightage on metal; what happens to capital goods companies, what happens to industries which are impacted by exports from China. So, we will have to watch this thing very carefully.  Q: My last question to you is do you expect the real gains in the economy and earnings to match the mood and momentum that we have been witnessing at this point of time or do you think it is a possibility that valuation may expand because of an election verdict hopes of a change to an extent that we get a blow out in the market but the real gains are much slower then that and at some point they become a frustrating factor. Do you see this as a possibility or do you think the real gains will skip steps with market gains?  A: I don’t think market will always be ahead of it. We have been here for 20 years, market will be always be ahead of it and the real gain possibility, I agree to your second point, it will be gradual because there is no magic wand with anyone which can change like scenario in three months. But if the verdict is positive, markets may price in significantly ahead of time but it’s all about valuation. Today we are comfortable pricing in 14 times valuation for FY15. In the change situation, we may comfortably price it 17 times. So, to that extent there is a room because the local participation has been dismal.  Since you are ending, let me just make one last point though we have been coming and screaming to retail investors that last one year has been the time to participate but I am really afraid that if there is a positive verdict and the people who are waiting because there will always be something in the market which will be uncertain. If people just keep waiting that let the election come in and then we will participate, I am afraid that it might be too late. So, my urge to people is that if you have equity exposure which has run down to zero or 5-10 percent, don’t wait for the last event keep lot of dry powder certainly in your pocket but start to participate in the market. So, at least you will have the interest to monitor what is happening here."

Online food delivery service GrubHub Inc (GRUB.N) saw its shares soar as much as 57 percent in one of the biggest first-day jumps so far this year.  Shares in Healthcare IT company IMS health (IMS.N), software maker Five9 Inc (FIVN.O) and energy software company Opower Inc (OPWR.N) also jumped well above their offer prices.  King's first-day performance has offered the worst so far this year, a rare blemish in a strengthening IPO market.  Improving economic fundamentals, record low interest rates and strong capital markets have boosted the U.S. IPO markets, nearly doubling IPO volumes for the first quarter and making it the busiest IPO season since the dotcom boom of 2000.  ""The King offering was so oversubscribed and failed miserably but there is certainly a lot of appetite for new issues which goes to show that the IPO market is not deal specific,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.  ""There is a lot of liquidity around,"" Ablin added.  Last week, King Digital fell as much as 16 percent in their debut, underscoring investor concern about the company's heavy reliance on its hit game, ""Candy Crush Saga"", and dampening hopes that its coming-out party could revive investor interest in the mobile gaming industry.  For some investors, the IPO brought back memories of the Internet boom and bust in 1998-2001, where profitability and other financial fundamentals of companies took the back seat to a raging fad about anything with a dotcom identity.  IPO activity during the first quarter totaled $47.2 billion, an increase of 98 percent from last year at this time and the strongest annual start for global IPOs since 2010.  Some analysts though feel that the strong appetite is for smaller deals and say larger offerings are more difficult to price.  ""I think it has been a really hot IPO market for small deals and specialty industries like GrubHub or companies which are not tied to an economic cycle,"" said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.  Bigger offerings such as the upcoming Ally Financial, GE Capital and even Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, will be subject to much tighter scrutiny.  ""Investors want original IPOs and fewer spin-offs or private equity kind of deals. They are looking for a whole portfolio of small and unique stories in their basket,"" Ablin said.  GrubHub shares were trading up 38 percent at $35.90, while those of IMS Health were up 12.3 percent at $22.46 in afternoon trading on Friday.  Shares of Five9 were up 15 percent at $8.08 and those of Opower were up 21 percent at $23.02."

In Vancouver, architect Michael Green has ...",2014-04-03T11:15:20Z,"wood and less steel and concrete in building and bridge construction would substantially reduce global carbon dioxide emissions and fossil fuel consumption.         Despite an established forest conservation theory holding that tree harvesting should be strictly minimized to prevent the loss of biodiversity and to maintain carbon storage capacity, the new study shows that sustainable management of wood resources can achieve both goals while also reducing fossil fuel burning. The results were published March 28 in the Journal of Sustainable Forestry.  In the comprehensive study, scientists from the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies (F&ES) and the University of Washington's College of the Environment evaluated a range of scenarios, including leaving forests untouched, burning wood for energy, and using various solid wood products for construction.   The researchers calculated that the amount of wood harvested globally each year (3.4 billion cubic meters) is equivalent to only about 20 percent of annual wood growth (17 billion cubic meters), and much of that harvest is burned inefficiently for cooking. They found that increasing the wood harvest to the equivalent of 34 per cent or more of annual wood growth would have profound and positive effects:  Between 14 per cent and 31per cent  of global CO2 emissions could be avoided by preventing emissions related to steel and concrete; by storing CO2 in the cellulose and lignin of wood products; and other factors. About 12 per cent to 19 per cent of annual global fossil fuel consumption would be saved including savings achieved because scrap wood and unsellable materials could be burned for energy, replacing fossil fuel consumption. Wood-based construction consumes much less energy than concrete or steel construction. Through efficient harvesting and product use, more CO2 is saved through the avoided emissions, materials, and wood energy than is lost from the harvested forest.  ''This study shows still another reason to appreciate forests - and another reason to not let them be permanently cleared for agriculture,'' said Chadwick Oliver, the Pinchot Professor of Forestry and Environmental Studies, director of the Global Institute of Sustainable Forestry at F&ES and lead author of the new study. ''Forest harvest creates a temporary opening that is needed by forest species such as butterflies and some birds and deer before it regrows to large trees. But conversion to agriculture is a permanent loss of all forest biodiversity.''  The manufacture of steel, concrete, and brick accounts for about 16 percent of global fossil fuel consumption. When the transport and assembly of steel, concrete, and brick products is considered, its share of fossil fuel burning is closer to 20 per cent to 30 per cent, Oliver said.  Reductions in fossil fuel consumption and carbon emissions from construction will become increasingly critical as demand for new buildings, bridges and other infrastructure is expected to surge worldwide in the coming decades with economic development in Asia, Africa, and South America, according to a previous F&ES study. And innovative construction techniques are now making wood even more effective in bridges and mid-rise apartment buildings.  According to Oliver, carefully managed harvesting also reduces the likelihood of catastrophic wildfires. ??And maintaining a mix of forest habitats and densities in non-reserved forests - in addition to keeping some global forests in reserves - would help preserve biodiversity in ecosystems worldwide, Oliver said. About 12.5 per cent of the world's forests are currently located in reserves.  ''Forests historically have had a diversity of habitats that different species need,'' Oliver said. ''This diversity can be maintained by harvesting some of the forest growth. And the harvested wood will save fossil fuel and CO2 and provide jobs - giving local people more reason to keep the forests.''  The article, ''Carbon, Fossil Fuel, and Biodiversity Mitigation with Woods and Forests,'' was co-authored by Nedal T. Nassar of the Yale School of Forestry & Environmental Studies and Bruce R. Lippke and James B. McCarter of the University of Washington.  - See more at: http://www.domain-b.com/environment/20140403_construction.html#sthash.qNYe2EJ7.dpuf"
