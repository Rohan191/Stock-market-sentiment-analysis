NMDC, which has been nominated as the nodal agency to bid out public-private partnership (PPP) project in the steel sector, has identified lands in the states of Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka and will start bidding process for at least two mega steel plants this fiscal. “We have identified location in all the four iron ore-rich states and are currently talking to the state governments for transfer of land and devising the model for the proposed initiative to be implemented under a special purpose vehicle (SPV) route. The size of the mega steel plants to be put under the bidding route soon to prospective enterpreneurs will depend on the linked iron ore resource provided by state mineral corporations,” NMDC chairman and managing director CS Verma said. Though the contours of the model is still being finalised, sources said that the mega steel plants would be largely designed on the lines of ultra mega power project (UMPP) scheme the power sector with NMDC acting as the nodal agency that would get all clearances for the projects before putting it under the bidding routre. It is understood that depending on the size of the iron ore resource attached with a project, state mineral corporations (who would provide the ore) may be offered between 26 to 49% holding in the SPV while steel producing companies can pick up the majority 51% stake. NMDC, which may also be a major merchant miner for these steel projects is yet to decide whether it would also hold anywhere between 10% to 26% stake in the project or just remain a supplier of the raw material. The move towards putting in place a PPP mechanism for mega steel plants in the country is being pushed to accelerate the pace of steel manufacturing in the country with the aim of reaching the production target of 300 million tonnes by 2025. Though the contour of the bidding framework is still to be worked out, it is likely to take into account upfront payment by companies, royalty on minerals, technology employed and time taken to complete the project. The mega steel project is expected to revive interest in greenfield projects for steel majors such as Tata Steel, Arcelor Mittal, Posco, JSW Steel that are grappling with severe land acquisition problems, raw material security issues and environment and forestry clearances. In fact, POSCO and Arcelor Mittal announced withdrawal of their proposed steel projects in Karnataka and Odisha respectively. The idea of mega steel project is to rapidly increase steel making capacity in the country and feed the growing demand for primary and secondary steel products from other manufacturing industries. The current steel production in the country stands at 90 million tonnes. Global steel demand grew only 2.1% in 2012 compared with 6.2 per cent in 2011. Global steel production inched up 1.2 per cent to 1.54 billion tonnes in 2012, registering the lowest growth of the last four years. Capacity utilisation also suffered and was lower than in 2011."

Jindal Steel & Power, which is currently in the process of completing power projects announced earlier ...",2014-04-05T05:43:41Z,"NEW DELHI: Adani Power, which overtook Tata Power as the nation's largest private-sector electricity producer, plans to go slow on capacity addition as uncertainties over fuel supply, weak financial health of state distributors and delays in environmental approvals prevent power companies from announcing new projects.  Adani Power on Thursday commissioned the fourth 660 mw unit of its Tiroda project in Maharashtra, which took the Gujarat-based company's total installed capacity to 8,620 mw.    Tata Power has installed capacity of 8,560 mw. Tata Power also has 1,000 mw in advance stage of commissioning and is considering 849.2 mw of projects based on wind, solar, hydro and gas energy in India and overseas.  Adani Power has accounted for 15% of the 17,000 mw of capacity added by developers in India during 2013-14. The company is hopeful of maintaining its leadership position in the sector, but it won't be announcing any projects for now. ""We will add only one more 660 mw unit at Tiroda to close this fiscal year with installed capacity of 9,280 mw,"" Chief Executive Vineet Jain told ET. ""Instead of adding more capacity in view of the ongoing concerns in the sector, we will now focus on consolidating our position.""  According to him, despite incurring Rs 3,000 crore of losses during the first three quarter of the just-ended fiscal year, it has been supplying power regularly to distribution utilities.  Many of India's state power distributors are in bad health, and are unable to make regular payments for the power they buy. While this hurts power producers, they are also badly hit by fuel shortages - mainly of coal and gas that fire most of the country's generation units - leading several of them to delay projects announced earlier and stay away from new announcements.  Out of country's 1.63 lakh mw of installed thermal power generation capacity, private sector accounts for 50,000 mw while utilities run by state and central governments control the balance. Jain said the company will go back to planning only after the next government provides more clarity over issues concerning the developers.  Jindal Steel & Power, which is currently in the process of completing power projects announced earlier, has decided not to add any capacity until fuel supply and environmental clearances are secured. ""Most of the capacity being added at the moment is from the projects which were started three-four years ago at which time the industry looked very promising,"" a company spokesperson said. ""It's important to know that no new significant power projects are coming up in the private sector.  And that would remain the trend until there is more certainty about the future of power sector as also availability of fuel and transmission capacity is assured,"" this person said.  In the past few weeks, Jindal Steel & Power commissioned two 600 mw units at Tanmar. It is scheduled to add one more 600 mw unit by October to have total capacity of 3,400 mw. ""In the power sector, many of the projects had reached a stage from where it was not possible for the developers to abandon the plans. So the only option for the developers was to commission their power projects,"" said Association of Power Producers Director-General Ashok Khurana."

Other major employers include the Wadia Group, Essar Energy, and outsourcer ...",2014-04-04T14:48:54Z,"Indian companies are becoming an increasingly important source of jobs in the UK, employing over 1 lakh people, and many have growth rates above 10 per cent, a new research has found.  In a joint report Grant Thornton and the Confederation of Indian Industry identified over 700 Indian-owned businesses in the UK, 12 of which employ at least 1,000 people each. Tata Group, which represents the bulk, employs just under 64,000 people across England, mostly within Tata Steel, which accounts for just over half that number. Other major employers include the Wadia Group, Essar Energy, and outsourcer Firstsource Solutions.  The report also noted many of the firms report high levels of growth despite Britain’s own low growth (GDP in the UK is expected to grow by 2.7 percent this year, according to the official forecasts). The 41 fastest growing businesses – which include big companies but mainly small and medium sized businesses – had growth rates of over 10 percent in 2013, while 26 companies experienced over 20 percent growth. Over half of those fastest growing 41 were businesses that had been started from scratch rather than being acquisitions.  “The growth rates are quite impressive when you consider the benign economic climate in the UK,” said Anuj Chande, head of Grant Thornton’s South Asia group.  While the majority of the fastest growing firms worked in the pharmaceutical sector, chemicals, technology and telecom also saw high rates of growth. “The sectors have remained enduringly strong for outward looking Indian enterprises attracted to UK known-how, technology and market positioning,” noted the report.  Much of the growth appears to be happening outside London, with just under 30 percent of the fastest growing companies based in the capital. “These patterns are encouraging signs that other UK regions have successfully established themselves as centres of expertise able to attract inward investment.”  Chande said with economic growth picking up in the UK, there was likely to be “a reversion to pre-2008 levels of interest among Indian corporates in the UK.”  “We are already seeing increased activity,” he said, adding he had had a couple of inquiries in the last few days from Indian firms looking to invest in the UK.  Much of the interest was likely to come from those hoping to transfer skills and technology back to India, he said."

Increased profit-booking by funds and retail investors at prevailing record levels and a weak trend in the Asian markets, following overnight losses in the US market as investors awaited a key jobs report dampened the trading sentiment.  The 30-share BSE index Sensex was down 77.35 points or 0.34 per cent at 22,431.72 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty was down 20.05 points or 0.3 per cent at 6,716.05  Among BSE sectoral indices, capital goods index was down 1.04 per cent, followed by oil & gas 0.67 per cent and auto 0.59 per cent. On the other hand, realty and consumer durables remained investors' favourite and were up 1.68 per cent and 0.83 per cent, respectively.  Hindalco, Cipla, Tata Steel, Wipro and SBI were the top five Sensex gainers, while the top five losers were BHEL, GAIL, Bharti Airtel, ONGC and L&T.  Asian stocks swung between gains and losses amid low trading volume, leaving the regional gauge on course for a second week of gains, as investors await US non-farm payrolls data today.  Nikkei 225 was down 8 points or 0.05 per cent at 15,064, Hang Seng fell 46.32 points or 0.21 per cent to 22,518.76, ASX 200 was up 12.94 points or 0.24 per cent at 5,422.83 and Shanghai was up 11.88 points or 0.58 per cent at 2,055.58.  The US non-farm payrolls data is expected to show the US economy added 195,000 jobs in March, up from 175,000 in February, and the unemployment rate ticked down to 6.6 per cent from 6.7 per cent.  US data was mixed, with the services sector showing growth, but employment components showed weakness. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week.  The Wall Street had ended lower on Thursday as investors turned cautious ahead of Friday's monthly jobs report. The Dow Jones industrial average dipped 0.45 of a point to close at 16,572.55, after hitting an intra-day record of 16,604.15.  The S&P 500 fell 2.13 points or 0.11 per cent to finish at 1,888.77. It also hit an intra-day record high of 1,893.80. The Nasdaq Composite declined 38.71 points or 0.91 per cent to end at 4,237.74."
