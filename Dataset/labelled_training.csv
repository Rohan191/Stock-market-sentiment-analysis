101,ril,"(Reuters) - Strong debuts of four new listings on Friday put a shine back on the IPO market after a wobbly debut last week by ""Candy Crush Saga"" maker King Digital Entertainment Plc (KING.N) brought a bustling market back to earth.  Online food delivery service GrubHub Inc (GRUB.N) saw its shares soar as much as 57 percent in one of the biggest first-day jumps so far this year.  Shares in Healthcare IT company IMS health (IMS.N), software maker Five9 Inc (FIVN.O) and energy software company Opower Inc (OPWR.N) also jumped well above their offer prices.  King's first-day performance has offered the worst so far this year, a rare blemish in a strengthening IPO market.  Improving economic fundamentals, record low interest rates and strong capital markets have boosted the U.S. IPO markets, nearly doubling IPO volumes for the first quarter and making it the busiest IPO season since the dotcom boom of 2000.  ""The King offering was so oversubscribed and failed miserably but there is certainly a lot of appetite for new issues which goes to show that the IPO market is not deal specific,"" said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank.  ""There is a lot of liquidity around,"" Ablin added.  Last week, King Digital fell as much as 16 percent in their debut, underscoring investor concern about the company's heavy reliance on its hit game, ""Candy Crush Saga"", and dampening hopes that its coming-out party could revive investor interest in the mobile gaming industry.  For some investors, the IPO brought back memories of the Internet boom and bust in 1998-2001, where profitability and other financial fundamentals of companies took the back seat to a raging fad about anything with a dotcom identity.  IPO activity during the first quarter totaled $47.2 billion, an increase of 98 percent from last year at this time and the strongest annual start for global IPOs since 2010.  Some analysts though feel that the strong appetite is for smaller deals and say larger offerings are more difficult to price.  ""I think it has been a really hot IPO market for small deals and specialty industries like GrubHub or companies which are not tied to an economic cycle,"" said Josef Schuster, founder of IPOX Schuster, a Chicago-based IPO research and investment house.  Bigger offerings such as the upcoming Ally Financial, GE Capital and even Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd, will be subject to much tighter scrutiny.  ""Investors want original IPOs and fewer spin-offs or private equity kind of deals. They are looking for a whole portfolio of small and unique stories in their basket,"" Ablin said.  GrubHub shares were trading up 38 percent at $35.90, while those of IMS Health were up 12.3 percent at $22.46 in afternoon trading on Friday.  Shares of Five9 were up 15 percent at $8.08 and those of Opower were up 21 percent at $23.02.",2014-04-04T18:23:39Z,Negative

104,ril,"NEW DELHI: Hit hard by Election Commission deferring gas price revision, Reliance Industries has written to the poll watchdog asking it to reconsider the directive as the decision to raise rates was taken months before polls were declared and even the Supreme Court has not stayed the move.   RIL group president V Balasubramanian on April 2 wrote to the chief election commissioner VS Sampath saying the revision of its eastern offshore KG-D6 gas price was a contractual necessity as the old rate of $4.2 expired on March 31.   To decide on the rate to be effective from April, 2014, the government had in 2012 constituted a committee under Prime Minister's economic advisory council chairman C Rangarajan. Based on the panel's recommendations, the Cabinet in June approved a new pricing formula.   The Cabinet on December 19 again approved the applicability of the formula on KG-D6 fields and the oil ministry notified the formula on January 10 this year.   ""You will appreciate that the said (natural gas pricing) guidelines were notified well before the model code of conduct came into force (in early March),"" he wrote.   Giving a detailed account of how gas prices were set and what methodology was followed in the present case, Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) said the Supreme Court is hearing a petition opposing the gas price hike on a day-to-day basis.   ""The Honorouble Supreme Court of India has not granted any injunction or stay on revision of the gas price and as such there is no question of deferring the revised prices of gas on teh basis of the matter being subjudice,"" it said.   The Election Commission on March 24 asked the government to defer implementation of the formula, which would have nearly doubled the rates to $8.3 per million British thermal unit, on grounds that the matter is sub-judice.   ""We trust that what is set forth above would clearly demonstrate the necesity for reconsideration of the decision of the Honourable Election Commission taken on March 24 and we earnestly request you to do so,"" RIL added.",2014-04-04T18:59:26Z,Negative

107,ril,"With the countdown to the elections having begun, the market has started pricing in the election verdict to a certain extent after witnessing a fairly robust rally aided by some serious flows from global investors.  Although market made new highs in the past few days, it was devoid of whole-hearted participation from retail investors. In an interview with Udayan Mukherjee on CNBC-TV18, Madhu Kela of Reliance Capital said since 2010, most investors bestowed faith in asset classes other than equities. But now, assets like gold have fallen flat and equities have bounced back. Despite this, investors have not returned to equities.  To beat the gloom and pessimism among local investors, a strong government and decisive action are needed, he said. While admitting the current government had swung into action for the last few months, which did help participation, a lot will improve if stability comes at the Centre. He sees the market making sharp upmoves if all goes as planned.  Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview:  Q: How have you read this run-up to the elections and what part of the election verdict is in the price already?  A: I think market is certainly in a better mood as compared with what we have been for so many years. The breadth of the market has increased and we are seeing some participation in the sectors which didn’t participate for a long period of time. If opinion polls were to be believed with a real stable government that gets 240-250 plus seats and one can bank on the government that is going to be around for five years then I do not think that what all could happen in India is priced in. I think there would still be a long way to go.  Q: You are in a good position to gauge a local participation as well. In the last few weeks since the market took out its previous top, have you seen participation come back to an extent or are people still saying we will rather watch the election verdict and then take that plunge?  A: I think the smart money maybe the high networth individuals have started to participate a bit, but it’s still a long way to go. We have had one lakh twenty thousand crore rupees of redemptions from mutual funds and insurance companies from April of 2010 till December last year; I do not have the updated number for last two-three months, but I am just saying that in this period also people saved money that got diverted to gold where people have made no money, it got diverted to fixed income investment which barely been able to hedge the inflation and has got invested in property where people have not made money.  So, people have kept selling equities for last three-four years and have kept on investing in other asset classes that have become rather illiquid and as we have seen in the past, once market starts to run and people get this feeling that we are left away, I think the participation could be of a very different nature and size and that certainly not there.  I see small money trickling in from here and there; whatever risk we see even in the B group stocks, if you analyse it deeply, except the top 15-20 liquid names, lot of the stock price rise is on very thin delivery volume. So, it is not reflecting any huge participation from any class of investors.  Q: You said that maybe the market has not fully priced in the election event. If indeed the opinion polls were correct then post the election verdict, how much more upside would you give the Nifty and also the rupee versus dollar which has also started pricing in this outcome?  A: Let me take you back a bit, we have had a five year of very sluggish market environment wherein the index broadly has remained where it was at 2008 level. It has just broken down up by 1,000 points or 1,500 points. But if we see the bipolarity in the market only then we will be able to understand how much more could you go. This one index which is IT, pharmaceutical, fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) maybe that index is at 50,000 and the other index by definition will be at 12,500-13,000 which was substantially higher in 2008. So, there has been a huge correction of 50-60-70 percent in the index as a whole.  So, when we say that we have a stable government, we are expecting that there will be confidence in the mood of industrialist and investors to come and participate, specifically the local people and there are so many outflows which have happened. So, a lot of money could pour into these sectors that have been underperforming for last five years and little bit of impetus from the government and policy forthcoming could completely change the sentiment and just to give credit to this government; I think lot of work has actually happened in the last six-nine months and partially market is even reflecting that mood.  If you have a decisive government at the Centre, which is proactive to economy and to market, there is still a long-long way. Something fell from Rs 100 to Rs 10 and it has gone from Rs 10 to Rs 15, you do not say that it has gone up 50 percent so it is fully priced.  Q: Let me play devil’s advocate and re-phrase the question slightly differently - over the last few weeks if you have conversations with global investors, they will point out that India is actually doing much better in a relative sense compared to its emerging markets. They talk about current account deficit (CAD), consumer price index (CPI) coming down, the rupee has cooled down, now all of this is happening not by the next government which the market is talking about but by the current government. So, why should the markets start to rally and see significant jump in valuations if this government changes into a new government which is an unknown quantity?  A: That is the nature of the market. There was a lot of value, one had the guts to thumb the table and say that for a long-term investor, and maybe this is the right time. So, market always needs an excuse to go up and after it starts going up, it starts attributing reasons why it has gone up. The reasons could be anything. There was virtually no participation from the people and little bit change in the mood that has caused this rally. This also got huge support from the calm international sentiment, basically so much money got printed in world in the last three-four years, part of the money has come and because India is doing well, more and more investors who are underweight on India are compelled to look at India and start to participate.  The nature of buying that I hear is all basket buying from sovereign funds which is why you are seeing that the whole mood changes, not only attributed to this upcoming new government but also partially because the valuation whereby in our side and partially because of the problems in other emerging markets: off late problems in Russia, the ongoing problems in Brazil, the problems in China have found India to be relatively safer given circumstances and the foreign institutional investors (FII) money has poured in.  As you said, being a devil’s advocate, conversely, if you do not have a stable and a good perceived government vis-à-vis market in the economy then I would not be surprised that this whole sentiment will turn again and it could yet again become negative. Therefore, market is certainly hoping in the last two-three months that we will have a more stable, pro-active market forward looking government at the Centre over the next five years.   Q: What would constitute forward looking is my next question to you because we have seen this kind of market movements hinging around election verdicts in the past and they have not always been the most sanguine over the period of time, you will re-call yourself the last United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was met with a 18 percent rally in the index over just two days only to be followed by three-four years of utter frustration. What will convince the market this time that despite its favoured government coming to power on the May 16, we are not going to walk down the same path as we did four-five years back?  A: First and foremost are the absolute numbers. There is a difference between what you can do when you have210 seats and what you can do when you have 250-260 seats.  There is so much money floating around in the world which has not been able to park at one percent interest rate; in countries like Germany, interest rates are still running merely at zero or negative percent, even in the US, the interest rate are absolutely at dismal level. So, any person who comes at the Centre and who can give a strong confidence to international investors that we mean business, we will fix up all our small issues. There is something like goods and services tax (GST) which is been pending for five years, if we assume after the formation of the government, it will be implemented in the next 6-12 months. Now, lot of experts have attributed that can contribute minimum 1-1.5 percent to the economy.  Lot of what was pending has also got done in the last six-nine months which is why you see the mood of the market where it is today. So, market is hoping that the new government which comes in will finish off whatever is unfinished in terms of the agenda and will be able to take few steps that will lead the investors, by and large, whether it is local or foreign investors to believe that we are in the right path and that sentiment given the global markets and given local liquidity, I will not be surprised that even we attract a lot of foreign direct investors (FDI) flows, we attract a lot of debt flows, as you have seen in the last three months little bit of sentiment change and we attracted like Rs 30,000-35,000 crore of debt inflow.  Q: The point that you alluded to earlier, which is the kind of portfolio construct one must have these days because a very different set of stocks has led this pre-election rally. Are you prepared to go down already and buy those stocks which are still trading at 40-50 percent below their 2008 peaks? The stocks which have not moved which are trading in your words at 12000 Sensex or has the time for that not come yet, you would still be higher on the quality ladder and move to those stocks later?  A: If you see the construct of people’s mind in the last five years, majority of the fund managers had become defensive. So even if you have a very defensive bank in your portfolio, very few people were brave hearted to have gone and bought things which are running currently. So the first point is if the change happened for positive then everyone will have to run towards that and change the portfolio mix which is basically reducing your bet on defensives whether it is FMCG, technology or pharmaceutical as that is what has dominated your portfolio and that is where the returns have been for the last five years. It will hence be imperative for people to change.  Question is what do you do now? I think you buy companies which are going to be survivors in the 12500 index which I am alluding to. So if the government is not very positive, you still can find lot of value in the market and these are like bear market survivors for last five-six years. I hate to discuss stocks but let me just for the purpose of argument take something like one of the largest companies in India like Reliance Industries. It has not participated in the last five-six years in any run. No one argues that there is lot of value and the value is not discovered by the market because of the existing uncertainties. So I am saying whether it takes six months or 12-18 months, those uncertainties will go away. And if there is a more stable government at the Centre, may be those uncertainties will go away sooner than what the market is expecting. May be you start to participate in companies like them in order to build a portfolio because if you wait till May 16 and if the mandate is decisively positive, I am afraid it will be too late for you to change your portfolio completely.  Q: Would you go down the ladder right now and buy something like a metal stock or a public sector bank stock because those have started moving in the last few days and they move really fast, 30-40 percent in a week. Are you prepared to take that bet or should that bet come later even if you miss out early gains?  A: I am not prepared to take that bet where I am willing to buy anything where the balance sheet is completed fractured and the business model is yet not on the table which I can believe. So I am not willing to buy any of that. But even in a public sector bank, am I willing to bet one two-three banks? Yes I am willing to bet. But just because PSU banks are running, I will not buy the entire pack and say that it should be 10 percent of my portfolio.  Q: Last year, you spoke about HCL Technologies being one of our big bets. My question is not about HCL Tech specifically, it is about what you do with IT in your portfolio which has served you very good, do you bring down the weightage dramatically, throw it out of your portfolio or do you think this is a period of relative underperformance after which these stocks will generate returns again?  A: In a proper portfolio construct, you never throw IT completely away from your portfolio because like I have 15-16 percent weight on your overall index portfolio today. But certainly, you have to go a little bit underweight. If you have 10 names which are constituting overweight in your portfolio, you certainly sell off two-three names which you believe may not do as well and are very sensitive to currency. You certainly don't throw them but go underweight on IT.   The reason for me to say that you don't completely throw it out is - if the election verdict is other way round and there is a sense of uncertainty then again these will be the same sectors which have done well for last five years. They will come back all over again. Again, it will be so difficult if you are underweight to the extent of 10 percent in IT, it will be virtually impossible to come back and buy those companies 20 percent higher.    Q: What is your gut feeling this time, will the market price in the verdict the way the wind is blowing even before May 16 in which case the market would have rallied significantly more from where we have reached already leaving little valuation room for the market to go up 10 percent immediately after the results? Or do you think there will be a pause and the market will once again respond with a massive move after the election verdict. Of these two probabilities which one has a higher weightage in your mind?   A: This is a little tricky one because if you tell me whether it is 250 or 210 then I can answer that question but I don't know whether it is 220-230 or 250. If it is 250 or 250 plus, then I would say whatever the pause, it’s a clear cut buy on dips market, whatever dips comes is an opportunity and people will have to buy these sectors that are being neglected for a period of time. But if it is somewhat like 210-220 kind of a mandate, then market may pause and a lot of the upside which would have happened because of the strong government at the Centre may have been priced in even before the elections.  Q: Let me talk about the risk because we are now talking only about positive upside and where the market can go on the way up but there are always counterbalances?  A: Absolutely.  Q: Let me start with the global picture. By the time June is done and we are through with election season, what do you see in the second half of the year from a global perspective. Do you see any of those risks between June and December manifesting them in such a way that it can come in the way of a much bigger rally in the second half for our market?  A: Globally, the significant underperformance of emerging market over the last 24 months is a positive for us. You have seen outflow from emerging markets both in the fixed income as well as in equities. So, that has a room to surprise little bit on the positive side.  However, China risk is one probable risk at the back of my mind because of the happenings in the last three-four months. China is certainly not pleasant, certainly not for someone like me; so we will have to watch that closely in spite of their strong balance sheet, huge foreign exchange reserve to defend any short-term; this is a really bad thing that could happen but in the next six-nine months. This is one risk which I will closely monitor that has a big impact on India because we have significant weightage on metal; what happens to capital goods companies, what happens to industries which are impacted by exports from China. So, we will have to watch this thing very carefully.  Q: My last question to you is do you expect the real gains in the economy and earnings to match the mood and momentum that we have been witnessing at this point of time or do you think it is a possibility that valuation may expand because of an election verdict hopes of a change to an extent that we get a blow out in the market but the real gains are much slower then that and at some point they become a frustrating factor. Do you see this as a possibility or do you think the real gains will skip steps with market gains?  A: I don’t think market will always be ahead of it. We have been here for 20 years, market will be always be ahead of it and the real gain possibility, I agree to your second point, it will be gradual because there is no magic wand with anyone which can change like scenario in three months. But if the verdict is positive, markets may price in significantly ahead of time but it’s all about valuation. Today we are comfortable pricing in 14 times valuation for FY15. In the change situation, we may comfortably price it 17 times. So, to that extent there is a room because the local participation has been dismal.  Since you are ending, let me just make one last point though we have been coming and screaming to retail investors that last one year has been the time to participate but I am really afraid that if there is a positive verdict and the people who are waiting because there will always be something in the market which will be uncertain. If people just keep waiting that let the election come in and then we will participate, I am afraid that it might be too late. So, my urge to people is that if you have equity exposure which has run down to zero or 5-10 percent, don’t wait for the last event keep lot of dry powder certainly in your pocket but start to participate in the market. So, at least you will have the interest to monitor what is happening here.",2014-04-05T09:04:07Z,Average

Energy group RIL's five-year gas supply agreements with sectors, including fertiliser makers and power producers expired at midnight Monday, requiring buyers to sign new contracts for supplies from its D6 block in the Krishna Godavari basin. ""RIL will continue to supply gas at $4.20 (per million British thermal units). The Fertiliser Association of India (FAI) and RIL will sit together and finalise the (next contracts) agreements as early as possible,"" Fertiliser Secretary Shaktikanta Das told reporters on Monday. Das did not elaborate on the duration or other terms of potential new contracts between RIL and the fertiliser companies. The cabinet last year approved a formula that linked prices of locally produced gas with global benchmarks, which would have nearly doubled gas prices from current levels from Tuesday. The Election Commission asked the government to defer the price increase until the completion of the five-week general election in the middle of May. India's main opposition party Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which surveys show is on course to become the largest parliamentary party, has said it will review the gas pricing formula if it is elected.

109,ril,"NEW DELHI: BP Plc (formerly British Petroleum) and Niko Resources of Canada have become party to Reliance Industries Ltd's arbitration proceedings against the government's decision to levy a $1.8 billion penalty for fall in gas output from the KG-D6 field off the Andhra coast.  The two companies, which are RIL's partners in the field, served separate arbitration notices earlier this week, sources said.  The proposed hike in gas prices, in line with a formula proposed by a panel under PMEAC chairman C Rangarajan, has been put on hold by the Election Commission. But BP and Niko have been forced to take the step to ensure they are not left out in case the decision is implemented after the elections. The government on Friday asked RIL to continue supplies at current prices.   After the government in January notified the new pricing regime for all producers, which would have seen prices doubling to $8 per unit from April 1, senior oil ministry officials took the stand that in KG-D6, only Reliance would get the benefit of the proposed higher gas price, provided it furnished a bank guarantee worth the value of gas it failed to supply as per the contract.  The officials took the stand after Reliance said it would furnish bank guarantee to cover its holding in the field. Niko has been a 10% partner right from the beginning. Reliance later sold 30% to BP and now holds 60%.  The partners initially had also argued that the operator, or the company in charge of running a field, represents all consortium partners and the officials were splitting hair by asking them to furnish bank guarantees individually in ratio of their holding.  Reliance had initiated the arbitration proceedings after then oil minister S Jaipal Reddy imposed the penalty by not allowing Reliance to recover costs as a punishment for production falling to a 10th of the commitment. Reliance disputed this by saying there was no provision in the contract for such a move and the production has fallen due to geological surprises.  Sources said BP and Niko, like RIL, maintain that the production sharing contract does not provide for a penalty in the form of denying costs incurred if output lags behind projections made in field investment plans.",2014-03-29T01:05:39Z,Negative

News Infocus Allegations of purchase of land at concessional rates in Gujarat are Baseless: RIL One allegation that is making rounds is that Gujarat government bought cheap land from farmers and gave it to Reliance Industries at concessional rates, however the facts are completely opposite. We would like to make it absolutely clear that more than 90% of land that we acquired for our plants in Gujarat have been bought directly from farmers. The price that we paid to the farmers was more than the market rates. We have not violated any rules in the process of acquiring land and all rules have been followed. Thousands of farmers of Gujarat are our partners in the process of industrialisation. We would like to submit that thousands of families in Gujarat have benefitted from the process of industrialisation and they are not only part of Team Reliance but also Team India. Some politicians have been making unsubstantiated statements against Reliance for grabbing attention and instant mileage. They tend to make sweeping statements for instant gratification without corroborative evidence.

Keep EC away from Politics of Disinformation: RIL A political party has written to the Election Commission (EC) to keep on hold a bonafide decision of the Union Cabinet on gas pricing. The party has a history of ill-informed diatribe. It is thus important to examine established conventions in this regard.When the model code of conduct (MCC) is in force, the government in power cannot take any new decision. New decisions mean undue benefit to the ruling political party.By implication, decisions already taken by the state or the central governmentcontinue to be implemented. For example, schemes such MNREGA, Sarva Siksha Abhiyan, etc, which are for the benefit of the masses continue to be in effect. Similarly contracts and projects already awarded prior to the kicking in of MCC continue to be honoured. The decision to implement the new price from April 1, 2014 is part of this contractual obligation.This decision was taken keeping in view of the fact that the current gas prices are valid only till March 31, 2014. The existing code of conduct came into force on 5th March 2014 and the cabinet decided on the new gas price policy on June 27th, 2013 and notified the same on January 10th 2014.

111,ril,"It is expected that RIL will come up with a simplified gas supply pact term sheet to buyers that would be valid till replaced by a new one The Supreme Court is likely to come up with a verdict on the appointment of a third arbitrator over a conflict between RIL (Reliance Industries) and the government, says a report.  The arbitration process is stuck over appointment of a third member in the panel as RIL was batting for a foreign, neutral, arbitrator to head the three-member panel, the report added. RIL's current gas sale and purchase agreements (GSPAs) also expire today. It is expected that RIL will come up with a simplified gas supply pact term sheet to buyers that would be valid till replaced by a new one, the report further said. In the new GSPA, RIL has proposed to charge government-fixed rate for natural gas on Gross Calorific Value (GCV) basis instead of current practice of billing $4.205 per million British thermal unit on Net Calorific Value (NCV) basis.  The heat produced from natural gas is calculated in calorific value. GCV or NCV is the rate at which heat is measured (1 GCV = 0.9 NCV). Billing urea plants on the new price of $8.3 per mmBtu on GCV would mean an actual rate of $9.13 on NCV basis.  Gas comprises almost 80% of the production cost of urea. An increase of $1 per mmBtu in gas price translates into an enhanced cost of production of about Rs 1,369 per ton. For 18 million tons of urea produced from gas, $1 per mmBtu price increase translates into an increase in cost of almost Rs. 2,465.1 crore. While RIL wanted to sign new GSPAs on a quarterly basis, it later agreed to the demand from fertiliser majors for a deal of either one year or five years. At present, there are 50 GSPAs for KG-D6 output in the liquefied petroleum gas, fertiliser, power and city gas sectors; these were signed in 2009. RIL signed GSPAs with 16 fertiliser companies in 2009, which will expire today. Fertiliser companies have objected to RIL's move to change some terms instead of renewing the existing contracts with new pricing formula. Recently, the company in a statement, said, “RIL has forwarded GSPA to fertilizer customers since the existing GSPA is valid till March 31, 2014. Since the new GSPA is under discussions, to facilitate gas supply from April 1, 2014, RIL has also forwarded a GSPA term sheet which will be valid till the new GSPA is finalised between the parties. The GSPA term sheet is currently under discussion with the buyers.” It said that in the GSPA term sheet, RIL has proposed that buyers pay price approved by the government under the provisions of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC).

115,ril,"Reliance has released following statement A number of misconceptions have been floating around the issue of gas price hike. One such misconception is that the Government will increase fertilizer prices immediately, with the increase in gas price. It is alleged that this shall lead to increase in prices of all food grains produced by the farmers. We want to place certain facts for consideration. Close to 40% of gas consumed in the country is imported in the form of LNG. Current price of LNG imported in the country is around USD 18 per million British thermal unit. Even at domestic gas price of USD 8 per million British thermal unit, imported LNG will be costlier by at least USD 10 per million British thermal unit, i.e. it will cost more than double the price paid to domestic gas producers. The moot point is why those who are raising the issue about higher domestic gas price are quiet about increased profits that international gas companies will be making by supplying gas to India at much higher prices. Are these vested interests aligned with those of the international gas companies? Fertilizer prices are set by the government and not on the basis of cost of fertilizer production. About 75% of domestic gas is being produced by public sector companies. As per media reports, ONGC alone will benefit to the tune of INR 16,000 crore following the price hike. Government's income will also increase due to higher royalty and taxes. The increased income to the Government will be much higher than additional subsidy that it will have to shell out for the fertilizer sector. Thus, the Government will have no reason to pass on increased gas price to farmers. With regard to power sector, we would like to clarify that gas produced by RIL is not being used presently by any power producer in the country. In any case, only 5% of power produced in India is produced from gas and the remaining 95% is produced by coal, hydel and nuclear power plants. Thus, this propaganda that gas price hike will increase power tariffs dramatically is misplaced. Therefore, the issue about power and fertilizer rates going up due to increase in gas prices is only a political stunt devoid of facts.",2014-03-31T03:40:46Z,Average
116,ril,"According to Indian High Commission in Singapore, a major portion of the investment had come into Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd, which is 100 per cent owned by Mukesh Ambani personally. The Supreme Court has sought a report by the government on the steps the latter has taken after the High Commission of India in Singapore requested an investigation around three years ago pertaining to the alleged Rs 6,530 crore investment by Singapore-based Biometrix Marketing Pte Ltd and Strasbourg Holdings in four Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) companies. The Indian High Commission, in August 2011, had written to the government asking to enquire the aforesaid investment made in 2007-08 in the Mukesh Ambani-led companies—Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure, Relogistics Infrastructure, Reliance Ports and Reliance Utilities—by Biometrix Marketing Pte Ltd, in which Strasbourg Holdings had 91 per cent stake. During an investigation by Indian High Commission in Singapore, Biometrix was found a “one-room defunct company in Singapore” that does not do any business and was closed most of the time. Following this, Indian High Commission in Singapore wrote a letter to Indian government, asking to enquire the investment. “We want to know what inquiry was done in the matter after the High Commission’s letter,” a bench headed by justice BS Chauhan told Solicitor General Mohan Parasaran, while hearing pleas challenging the government's decision to double the price of natural gas and seeking cancellation of RIL’s contract for exploration of oil and gas from KG-D6 block.

117,ril,"(Reuters) - Billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Retail is poised to perform a rare feat in India's notoriously complex retail market by finally turning a profit. The time and cost involved, however, could put off global and local rivals from even trying to copy it. It took Reliance Retail, part of Ambani's conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (RELI.NS), seven years of losses, bruising trial-and-error and over $1 billion in investments to find a formula that works for India, the world's fifth largest retail market and one of its fastest growing. This seemingly inexhaustible combination of financing and patience has given Reliance an edge over smaller local rivals that lack its deep pockets, and global chains like Carrefour SA (CARR.PA) and Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) which would have to invest vast amounts of capital, time and energy to set up retail shops in India but reap miniscule initial returns. ""No global chain will pour money immediately to build up a business here even if they can,"" said Saloni Nangia, president of retail consultancy Technopak India. ""They will be cautious about their investments, keeping in mind the political landscape in India and shareholder sentiment back home."" With 1.2 billion people and a rapidly growing middle class, India's potential has long beguiled retailers but regulatory uncertainty, poor infrastructure and opposition from politically powerful small traders has kept most global chains at bay. The government gave foreign supermarket chains the green light in September 2012, but then left it up to individual states to enact the legislation. Many didn't, fearing a backlash from local traders. So far, only Britain's Tesco (TSCO.L) has announced it would make a relatively modest $110 million foray into two states. Executives at Wal-Mart and Carrefour, which operate wholesale outlets in India, have said they are awaiting regulatory clarity and the outcome of national elections next month before setting up retail shops. Ambani, India's richest man and majority shareholder of a company with a $15 billion cash pile and the world's largest oil refinery, took advantage of this absence of major league competitors to set up his own version of a global retail chain. Reliance Retail recently gave Reuters exclusive access to its state-of-the-art warehouse. Several senior executives also gave Reuters rare details about the company's operations but all declined to be identified because of a company policy that prohibits them from speaking to the media. Since it was established in 2006, Reliance Retail has revamped its supply chain and decentralised decision-making to ensure flexibility. From September, it has opened stores at the rate of almost one a day even as India's economy grows at its weakest pace in a decade. Reliance Retail, which at end-December had 1,577 stores, expects to post a profit by the end of fiscal 2014 partly due to stronger sales at its grocery business, the largest contributor to revenue, said one senior company official. The retailer posted an operating profit of 1.06 billion rupees for the three months ended December 2013, its first ever quarterly profit. Revenue grew 38 percent year-on-year in the same period and same-store sales also rose by just over a fifth. Reliance Retail did not give comparative figures or disclose income numbers, but its quarterly sales and revenue were far ahead of local rivals Future Retail (FURE.NS) and Trent Ltd (TREN.NS), which operate loss-making hypermarkets. ""If Reliance are able to sustain their success it will prove that modern retail as a business can be profitable in India,"" said Harminder Sahani, managing director of Gurgaon-based retail consultancy Wazir Advisors. Reliance Retail's quarterly revenue was $641 million, almost twice as much as Future Retail's revenue for the same period and far more than Trent's $45.7 million. Same-store sales at Future Retail, majority owned by Future Group, rose 3.3 percent during the December quarter, while analysts said Tata Group's Trent saw an increase of less than 10 percent for the quarter. SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY Reliance's growth has turned it into a formidable competitor for any global retailer that ventures into India, and regulations that currently favour local companies mean it is likely to keep its edge. Foreign retailers must partner with a local company, and can own a maximum 51 percent stake in the joint venture. They must also source at least a third of their products locally, conditions which have spooked several global retailers. ""The competitive landscape will change now because Reliance is scaling up quickly, is turning around and will be in a better position to fight pricing wars with foreign chains,"" said Wazir Advisor's Sahani Even with these comparative advantages, Reliance Retail faces an uphill battle for growth. When Ambani first set up the company, he envisioned a $20 billion business by 2011, a goal that proved wildly ambitious. Last year, Reliance Retail set a target to grow revenue to a more modest $6-$8 billion by 2016-2017. Reliance generated just $1.8 billion in revenue in the nine months through December, a tiny fraction of India's $500 billion retail industry which is dominated by small, mom-and-pop shops. The growth of a Westernised, and more affluent, middle class that prefers hypermarket-style shopping is likely to favour Reliance. The company is also benefiting from a rise in nationalist sentiment among the influential individual traders who eased their stance towards home-grown retail chains after foreign retailers started circling, Technopak's president Nangia said. Reliance Retail was forced by local traders and politicians to shut its shops in the states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Jharkhand shortly after their launch several years ago. It now has 36 stores selling fresh produce in these states, its website shows. FIXING THE FOUNDATION As it built up its network, Reliance Retail went through several management reshuffles - it is about to have the fourth head for the grocery business - and several executives said it has also gained expertise. ""We have got a better understanding of some important aspects like real estate, store build and manpower,"" a senior company official said. Until two years ago, for example, Reliance would fly fresh strawberries from western India for delivery to stores in other parts of the country at a high cost. It now uses trucks to transport the fruit, and has invested in cold storage at farms. About two years ago, Reliance rolled out technology that gives hourly updates on margins and revenue by store, city and region, along with data on how products are selling. Such systems are standard in developed markets, but new to India. Previously, Reliance relied on weekly supply chain reports. Reliance now intensifies its research before choosing locations, and tests product line-ups locally before opening stores, executives said. Earlier, it would often test items after a store opened, which meant frequent and costly tinkering. Inventory decisions once set at Reliance's massive Mumbai headquarters are now made by individual store managers, enabling them to customise their stores to local preferences. And while Indian retailers often lease warehouses to save costs, Reliance is building its own so it can customise them. Its 400,000 square foot warehouse near Pune, which opened a year ago, has a translucent roof that lets in sunlight, saving electricity costs, and automated doors that allow machines, not labourers, to unload goods, company officials said. This model will be replicated in all the company's warehouses, they added. During a recent visit, trucks unloaded crates of detergent and refrigerators into the warehouse, which was stacked with goods ranging from TVs to toilet cleaners to ladies capri pants. ""Retail is a tough business to be in right now with the market slowing, and having the access to an uninterrupted source of capital decides who wins,"" said C.P.

204,tata,"New Delhi : NMDC, the country's largest iron ore miner, will soon invite expressions of interest (EoIs) from prospective public and private steel companies in acquiring majority stakes in four identified mega steel projects with capacity of 10-12 million tonne each. NMDC, which has been nominated as the nodal agency to bid out public-private partnership (PPP) project in the steel sector, has identified lands in the states of Jharkhand, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka and will start bidding process for at least two mega steel plants this fiscal. “We have identified location in all the four iron ore-rich states and are currently talking to the state governments for transfer of land and devising the model for the proposed initiative to be implemented under a special purpose vehicle (SPV) route. The size of the mega steel plants to be put under the bidding route soon to prospective enterpreneurs will depend on the linked iron ore resource provided by state mineral corporations,” NMDC chairman and managing director CS Verma said. Though the contours of the model is still being finalised, sources said that the mega steel plants would be largely designed on the lines of ultra mega power project (UMPP) scheme the power sector with NMDC acting as the nodal agency that would get all clearances for the projects before putting it under the bidding routre. It is understood that depending on the size of the iron ore resource attached with a project, state mineral corporations (who would provide the ore) may be offered between 26 to 49% holding in the SPV while steel producing companies can pick up the majority 51% stake. NMDC, which may also be a major merchant miner for these steel projects is yet to decide whether it would also hold anywhere between 10% to 26% stake in the project or just remain a supplier of the raw material. The move towards putting in place a PPP mechanism for mega steel plants in the country is being pushed to accelerate the pace of steel manufacturing in the country with the aim of reaching the production target of 300 million tonnes by 2025. Though the contour of the bidding framework is still to be worked out, it is likely to take into account upfront payment by companies, royalty on minerals, technology employed and time taken to complete the project. The mega steel project is expected to revive interest in greenfield projects for steel majors such as Tata Steel, Arcelor Mittal, Posco, JSW Steel that are grappling with severe land acquisition problems, raw material security issues and environment and forestry clearances. In fact, POSCO and Arcelor Mittal announced withdrawal of their proposed steel projects in Karnataka and Odisha respectively. The idea of mega steel project is to rapidly increase steel making capacity in the country and feed the growing demand for primary and secondary steel products from other manufacturing industries. The current steel production in the country stands at 90 million tonnes. Global steel demand grew only 2.1% in 2012 compared with 6.2 per cent in 2011. Global steel production inched up 1.2 per cent to 1.54 billion tonnes in 2012, registering the lowest growth of the last four years.

213,tata,"Indian companies are becoming an increasingly important source of jobs in the UK, employing over 1 lakh people, and many have growth rates above 10 per cent, a new research has found.  In a joint report Grant Thornton and the Confederation of Indian Industry identified over 700 Indian-owned businesses in the UK, 12 of which employ at least 1,000 people each. Tata Group, which represents the bulk, employs just under 64,000 people across England, mostly within Tata Steel, which accounts for just over half that number. Other major employers include the Wadia Group, Essar Energy, and outsourcer Firstsource Solutions.  The report also noted many of the firms report high levels of growth despite Britain’s own low growth (GDP in the UK is expected to grow by 2.7 percent this year, according to the official forecasts). The 41 fastest growing businesses – which include big companies but mainly small and medium sized businesses – had growth rates of over 10 percent in 2013, while 26 companies experienced over 20 percent growth. Over half of those fastest growing 41 were businesses that had been started from scratch rather than being acquisitions.  “The growth rates are quite impressive when you consider the benign economic climate in the UK,” said Anuj Chande, head of Grant Thornton’s South Asia group.  While the majority of the fastest growing firms worked in the pharmaceutical sector, chemicals, technology and telecom also saw high rates of growth. “The sectors have remained enduringly strong for outward looking Indian enterprises attracted to UK known-how, technology and market positioning,” noted the report.  Much of the growth appears to be happening outside London, with just under 30 percent of the fastest growing companies based in the capital. “These patterns are encouraging signs that other UK regions have successfully established themselves as centres of expertise able to attract inward investment.”  Chande said with economic growth picking up in the UK, there was likely to be “a reversion to pre-2008 levels of interest among Indian corporates in the UK.”  “We are already seeing increased activity,” he said, adding he had had a couple of inquiries in the last few days from Indian firms looking to invest in the UK.  Much of the interest was likely to come from those hoping to transfer skills and technology back to India, he said.",2014-04-04T14:48:54Z,Positive

The report titled ""India Meets Britain: Tracking the UK's Top Indian Companies"" also revealed that more than 50 per cent of the top 41 fastest-growing firms are in the technology & telecoms (32 per cent) and pharmaceuticals & chemicals (22 per cent) sectors.  Anuj Chande, head of South Asia Group at Grant Thornton LLP, said that sluggish growth potential in the Indian market prompted Indian investors to scale up investments in the UK.  Commenting on the compiled figures, he said, ""In light of sluggish growth potential in India, investors are increasingly eager to enter, or scale up their UK operations as the British economy re-enters a growth phase"".  Chande added that the cultural history of the two countries also plays a key role in several Indian executives' decisions for setting up a base in the UK.  Of the top 41 Indian companies operating in the UK, 29 per cent are based in London, 29 per cent in the North, 32 per cent in the South, and the remaining 10 per cent in the Midlands.",2014-04-05T06:33:47Z,Positive

The sources said the clarifications would be sought soon.  ""We don't have any information on this. We do not know about this,"" a Tata Sons spokesperson said when asked to comment on the CBI move.

The allotment of iron ore mines at Ankua, Singhbhum district of Jharkhand to Tata steel is also being enquired into, they said.  They said although the agency has so far not found any criminality in its enquiries but it will seek clarification from Tata and Mistry over some issues regarding tapped conversations where references were made about these deals.  They said a journalist from a TV channel and a senior executive of a leading newspaper group have already been examined by the agency.  Besides, executives of Reliance, Unitech and Tata Motors have also been examined by the agency in connection with its enquiries.

Bharti Airtel, India's largest and the world's fourth largest telco, is hoping to use funds raised in the coming fiscal year to further refinance debt which stood at $9.3 billion at December end, and thereby reducing its net finance costs. The net debt fell from $10.7 billion at the end of 2012. The company reports its fourth quarter results on April 29, which will give a clearer idea of its latest debt position. While declining to comment specifically on the planned bond issues, the company spokesperson said: ""On an ongoing basis, we keep evaluating opportunities to refinance part of our debt portfolio loans for most efficient costs and maturities."" The upcoming fund raising exercises would follow the three rounds of successful bond issues through which the company raised some $3.27 billion during 2013-14, which had helped the company refinance part of its existing debt.

The earlier contract ended on 31 March. “IBM’s global expertise to manage large infrastructure operations and application management, coupled with the new IT (information technology) capabilities we are developing in-house is the latest milestone in our strategy to build a world-class IT services platform as we enter into a new phase in our growth journey in both data and voice,” said Bharti Airtel’s chief information officer Harmeen Mehta. Airtel is also “building in-house capabilities and a strong partner ecosystem”, the company said—a sign that the telecom firm will evaluate and build relationships with other technology vendors and potentially hand out business to them, keeping IBM’s monopoly status in the contract in check, according to the company executive cited earlier. Bharti Airtel was set to reduce IBM’s share of the contract to about $100 million a year, Mint reported on 17 December. IBM has over the years used its relationship with Bharti Airtel as a global case study to win more business from clients. The five-year deal will also bring the new contract on par with Bharti Airtel’s other outsourcing contract with IBM in Africa to manage its African back-office IT operations, which will expire in 2019-20. This deal marks Bharti Airtel’s strategic shift in the business of outsourcing, extending to some of the functions that were previously being handled by IBM, according to two Bharti Airtel executives familiar with the development. The two executives declined to be named. The terms also mark a departure from the original total outsourcing strategy that Bharti Airtel under chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal had pioneered and was replicated by other telecom firms across the world. Unlike its earlier policy of complete outsourcing, the company is increasingly of the view that it can do a lot of things in-house, the executives said. Bharti Airtel may follow Idea Cellular Ltd’s model. Idea does not outsource everything, but several key network and IT functions are handled by its own employees. For Bharti, the change of strategy came about after Gopal Vittal become chief executive officer last year. “For new business streams, Airtel may explore other IT vendors. The current deal largely retains IT outsourcing under the previous contract and not new businesses of future like new data offerings and 4G. Some specific IT deals with Indian vendors are being negotiated and may be announced shortly, most likely to go to TCS (Tata Consultancy Services Ltd) and Tech Mahindra,” said the Bharti Airtel executive, with direct knowledge of the deal. The terms of the new deal come at a time when IBM has lost contracts with Tata Motors Ltd and other Tata group companies, as Mint reported on 20 May 2013. This contract could have an impact on other deal renewals that are due over the next few years in India, according to Kamlesh Bhatia, a research director at Gartner Inc. IBM has a five-year contract with Vodafone India Ltd worth more than $1 billion, which comes up for renewal in 2016-17. With Idea Cellular, IBM has a 10-year contract worth about $800-900 million. The contract comes up for renewal in 2019-20. The deal also comes at a time when IBM is grappling with tax claims and allegations of fraud in India amid slow growth in India, which had become the unofficial global delivery nerve centre for IBM in the 2000s during then CEO Samuel J. Palmisano’s tenure. When the outsourcing contract was originally signed, Bharti Airtel had roughly eight million customers and was at the cusp of the telecom boom in India in the early 2000s. Over the last 10 years, Bharti Airtel’s subscriber base has grown to 285 million, but the booming growth rates that it saw in the early 2000s no longer exist. IBM was trying hard to save the outsourcing contract in India, with CEO and chairman Ginni Rometty visiting India to meet Sunil Mittal in a last-ditch effort to save the contract, Mint reported in August.",2014-04-02T11:45:09Z,Positive
