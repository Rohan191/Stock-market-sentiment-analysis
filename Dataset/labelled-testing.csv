The RBI has raised the repo rate by 75 basis points since September to contain high inflation, but analysts had expected the central bank would keep rates steady ahead of general elections and an uncertain economic growth outlook. India's record-setting share rally has been sparked by heavy foreign buying - reaching a $3.3 billion in March - as analysts cite expectations of a recovery in the domestic economy, and bets that main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, perceived as more business-friendly, will come to power. However, analysts warn momentum could eventually wane, with investors on Tuesday also booking profits in recent outperformers such as banks.

1010,hindalco,"Global markets ended on a weak note in March, on the back of increasing geopolitical tensions, likely increase in US interest rates (from mid-2015) and signs of slowdown in China. US Fed Reserve chairperson Janet Yellen decided to cut the monthly asset bond purchase programme by another $10bn to $55bn per month. While this was expected what ruffled the markets was that the Fed hinted at raising rates by mid of 2015. On the domestic front, IIP continued to stagnate. On the external front, the trade deficit narrowed further in February 2014, helped by a sharp drop in imports. While the CPI and WPI inflation declined in February, the manufacturing (core) inflation remained resilient and even inched upwards. Unless manufacturing inflation reverses its trend, the risk of a rate hike remains credible, we opine. However, RBI maintained status quo in its April policy meet. The economic recovery in the US is seen getting further entrenched whereas, growth seems to be slackening in the Chinese economy. In response to this, the Chinese leadership has indicated that, it will announce some stimulus measures. Further stimulus measures are also expected from the ECB when it meets later this week. Markets will continue to closely watch the developments on the political front. Markets are betting on formation of stable government, which could put the infrastructure and industrial sector back on track. This will provide higher visibility to cyclical/investment-oriented sectors and will also give an upward bias to the current valuations of 15-15.5 times consensus FY15 earnings, we believe. Over the medium-to-long term, initiatives to revitalise infrastructure investment, anchor inflationary expectations and control the ballooning subsidies, will be important pre-requisites for the markets to move up sustainably. In the near term, we expect the markets to remain volatile. The momentum may continue over this period. We had indicated earlier that apart from defensives, we need to position ourselves to gain from the momentum in the domestic cyclical stocks. We continue to recommend a selective and balanced approach towards sectors. We do like select stocks in sectors like IT, media and private sector banks. However, we also recommend investing in stocks having strong balance sheets and ethical managements in beaten-down 'domestically-oriented' and 'investment-led' sectors. A favourable political outcome will lead to out-performance from these sectors/stocks vis-à-vis the markets. Key risks to our recommendation are political uncertainty, geo-political concerns globally, decline in foreign inflows, sharp currency depreciation and spike in oil prices. We feel that, at the current levels of about 6,700, the market will remain volatile, but the momentum will likely continue in the short term. This is, of course, based on the assumption that, the election results will be to the markets' liking in the sense that, there will be a stable coalition and reforms process will gain speed. Consequently, this will reduce the concerns on growth over the medium-to-long term. On interest rates, foreign liquidity as well as on growth, markets are seeing positive winds blowing across. Thus, the positive momentum may continue. The reason for volatility could be the valuations, which are in excess of 15 times-15.5 times FY15 consensus estimates. This is higher than the long-term average over the past 10 years. While valuations are not very expensive, they are not cheap also. Once the important political event is out of the way, markets will start looking at growth and valuations, which may create volatility. The economy may take some time post-elections, to come back on the high growth path.

Right from the initial trade, we observed immense buying interest among market participants, which resulted in a rally of nearly one-and-a-half per cent on Nifty; the index ended the session at the highest point of the day. The bulls maintained their optimism for the rest of the week, ignoring unfavourable global developments. In this process, our markets managed to conquer all intermediate resistance levels and closed at the highest point of the week. On a weekly basis, the capital goods, banking, PSU and oil & gas counters propelled the rally; whereas defensive sectors like IT and healthcare trimmed further to close on the losing side. Sensex and Nifty ended the week with sizable gains of 2.69 per cent and 3.09 per cent, respectively, over the previous week's closing.

The optimism was so strong that our market even overlooked the derivative expiry session and gave a genuine up move, barring the last half an hour of the session.

PCR-OI has decreased from 1.03 to 0.87 last week. This ratio has mainly decreased due to significant buildup in call options. In call options, huge buildup was seen the 6,700-7,100 range, while in put options significant buildup was seen in the 6,400-6,700 strike range.

1139,icicibank," Global markets ended on a weak note in March, on the back of increasing geopolitical tensions, likely increase in US interest rates (from mid-2015) and signs of slowdown in China. US Fed Reserve chairperson Janet Yellen decided to cut the monthly asset bond purchase programme by another $10bn to $55bn per month. While this was expected what ruffled the markets was that the Fed hinted at raising rates by mid of 2015.On the domestic front, IIP continued to stagnate. On the external front, the trade deficit narrowed further in February 2014, helped by a sharp drop in imports. While the CPI and WPI inflation declined in February, the manufacturing (core) inflation remained resilient and even inched upwards.Unless manufacturing inflation reverses its trend, the risk of a rate hike remains credible, we opine. However, RBI maintained status quo in its April policy meet. The economic recovery in the US is seen getting further entrenched whereas, growth seems to be slackening in the Chinese economy. In response to this, the Chinese leadership has indicated that, it will announce some stimulus measures. Further stimulus measures are also expected from the ECB when it meets later this week.Markets will continue to closely watch the developments on the political front. Markets are betting on formation of stable government, which could put the infrastructure and industrial sector back on track. This will provide higher visibility to cyclical/investment-oriented sectors and will also give an upward bias to the current valuations of 15-15.5 times consensus FY15 earnings, we believe. Over the medium-to-long term, initiatives to revitalise infrastructure investment, anchor inflationary expectations and control the ballooning subsidies, will be important pre-requisites for the markets to move up sustainably.In the near term, we expect the markets to remain volatile. The momentum may continue over this period. We had indicated earlier that apart from defensives, we need to position ourselves to gain from the momentum in the domestic cyclical stocks. We continue to recommend a selective and balanced approach towards sectors. We do like select stocks in sectors like IT, media and private sector banks. However, we also recommend investing in stocks having strong balance sheets and ethical managements in beaten-down 'domestically-oriented' and 'investment-led' sectors. A favourable political outcome will lead to out-performance from these sectors/stocks vis-à-vis the markets. Key risks to our recommendation are political uncertainty, geo-political concerns globally, decline in foreign inflows, sharp currency depreciation and spike in oil prices.We feel that, at the current levels of about 6,700, the market will remain volatile, but the momentum will likely continue in the short term. This is, of course, based on the assumption that, the election results will be to the markets' liking in the sense that, there will be a stable coalition and reforms process will gain speed. Consequently, this will reduce the concerns on growth over the medium-to-long term. On interest rates, foreign liquidity as well as on growth, markets are seeing positive winds blowing across. Thus, the positive momentum may continue.The reason for volatility could be the valuations, which are in excess of 15 times-15.5 times FY15 consensus estimates. This is higher than the long-term average over the past 10 years. While valuations are not very expensive, they are not cheap also. Once the important political event is out of the way, markets will start looking at growth and valuations, which may create volatility. The economy may take some time post-elections, to come back on the high growth path.

Both the bellwether indices, Sensex and Nifty, failed to maintain their all-time highs despite sustained capital inflows.  However, the S&P BSE benchmark declined afterwards to end at 22,359.50 on tail-end profit-booking, still showing a gain of 19.53 points, or 0.09 per cent. However, the NSE 50-share Nifty settled at 6,694.35, a tad lower from the last weekend's level of 6,695.90 after logging a fresh lifetime intra-day high of 6,776.75.  Brokers attributed the rally to investor hopes of a stable government after the forthcoming general elections and economy returning to high growth path.  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), at its April 1 policy meet, left the short-term lending rate, or repo, unchanged at 8 per cent and cash reserve ratio at 4 per cent.  Brokers said the RBI's decision was largely in line with investor expectations and failed to have any major immediate effect on the market.  Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued their buying spree, acquiring shares worth a net Rs 5,124.66 crore during the week, including the provisional figure of April 4, as per SEBI data.

1222,bhel,"Market scaled fresh life- time highs, but surrendered most of the gains on profit- booking towards end of the week on IMF report about slowdown in Indian economy due to""internal factors"". Both the bellwether indices, Sensex and Nifty, failed to maintain their all-time highs despite sustained capital inflows. The Sensex resumed up at 22,423.14 and shot up further to hit an all-time intra-trade high of 22,620.65 on strong buying on the back of persistent foreign capital inflows. However, the S&P BSE benchmark declined afterwards to end at 22,359.50 on tail-end profit-booking, still showing a gain of 19.53 points, or 0.09 per cent. However, the NSE 50-share Nifty settled at 6,694.35, a tad lower from the last weekend's level of 6,695.90 after logging a fresh lifetime intra-day high of 6,776.75. Brokers attributed the rally to investor hopes of a stable government after the forthcoming general elections and economy returning to high growth path. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), at it April 1 policy meet, left the short-term lending rate, or repo, unchanged at 8 per cent and cash reserve ratio at 4 per cent. Brokers said the RBI's decision was largely in line with investor expectations and failed to have any major immediate effect on the market. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) continued their buying spree, acquiring shares worth a net Rs 5,124.66 crore during the week, including the provisional figure of April 4, as per the SEBI's record. Realty, consumer durable, metal, pharma, refinery and IT counters attracted good buying interest while FMCG, banking and capital goods stocks suffered losses. Bank stocks fell after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) clarified that the option for spreading the mark-to-market losses over the three quarters ended on March 31, 2014 and no further extension was allowed, brokers said. Jignesh Chaudhary, Research Head, Veracity Broking Services said, ""The Indian equity markets achieved new heights in this trading week and also got some corrections on the last trading days. Heavy foreign buying continued to underpin the recent rally with overseas investors buying Indian shares. ""New bank licences were also issued to private players by RBI which also created a rally in the stocks. The Technical Indicators are expecting a correction in the market so CNX Nifty is expected to trade in the range of 6,650 to 6,675 and BSE Sensex to trade in the range of 22,250 to 22,345.""

1226,bhel,"Policy flip-flop and delay in approvals is causing India’s top private and public sector companies including Tata Power, Reliance Industries and Bhel to look outwards and to invest in countries that offer stable policy regimes and higher returns than at home. HT spoke to the management of the three companies — leaders in their respective territories — and was told that they are scouting for opportunities outside due to regulatory and policy delays.  The Rs. 33,000 crore-plus Tata Power is clearly focusing on growth outside the country. The company has added 8,500 mw since its inception within India, but has added projects worth 3,000 mw across the globe in its short two-year journey.  “We went international in last 2 years and clearly we no longer consider India as the only turf anymore… I have teams investing globally in four blocks including Africa, West Asia and Turkey, Saarc (including India) and South East Asia... whichever offers us a better option to grow, we will grow there,” Anil Sardana, MD, Tata Power told HT.  Tata Power is planning to add 26,000 mw capacity in 6-7 years, and a major chunk of its planned capacity expansion is expected to come from global projects.  “We have diversified in geographies and all of our investments made globally are offering higher returns than what you get in India…In India growth will depend on how fast clearances come… as and when India offers us the opportunity, we will continue to grow in India,” he added.  Public sector giant Bhel’s CMD BP Rao said the company has planned new manufacturing units in Dubai, Africa and South East Asia. “A slowdown has hit all sectors…it is not just the growth in the power sector that is seeing a contraction, but other areas where Bhel had planned big expansion, such as transportation,” Rao said, adding that as much Rs. 10,000 crore of investments planned are not happening, and despite follow-ups at the top level, decisions are not forthcoming.  Faced with delay in securing approvals and unstable policy practices, the Rs. 4 lakh crore-plus conglomerate Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) too is looking for growth outside India for the company’s largest and core business — oil and gas.  A senior RIL official seeking anonymity told HT that the company is focusing on expanding its international oil and gas business following regulatory issues on the home pitch . “We had a portfolio of 45 oil and gas exploration blocks in India in 2010-11 and thanks to the policy and pricing issues, the number is down to six,” the official said. RIL recently bagged two oil and gas blocks in Myanmaar.  “We are clearly focusing on growth outside India..we are in Venezuela and Iraq and will look at expanding there by developing oil blocks and setting up new refineries.",2014-03-30T21:14:13Z,Positive

Chidambaram. “This rally is not happening only due to the hope around a political party coming to power,” Kotak said. “India’s economy has bottomed out and that’s contributing.” Bhel tumbled 1.95%, extending this week’s loss to 8.3%, the most on the Sensex. NTPC declined 2.2%, the most since 28 February. The S&P BSE Capital Goods index declined 1.2% this week after a 16% advance last month. Tata Motors decreased 1.5%, the biggest loss since 18 March.

The Nifty's 6.81 percent gain in March was its best performance since a 9.8 percent gain in October. For the quarter, the index rose 6.35 percent, a second consecutive rise since its 9.9 percent gain in the October-December period.  The record-setting rally has been sparked by heavy foreign buying - reaching a provisional $3.2 billion so far this month - as analysts cite expectations the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party would win elections set to conclude by mid-May, given its perception of having a more market-friendly stance.

A result around there should reassure the optimists and tend to underpin the dollar and stocks. Perversely a much stronger read might not be so positive for shares since it could reignite speculation of an earlier rate hike from the Federal Reserve.

1238,bhel,"India’s benchmark stock index declined for a second day as some investors judged recent gains to all-time highs as excessive.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL), India’s biggest power-equipment maker, retreated for a fifth day. NTPC Ltd., India’s largest power producer, tumbled the most in five weeks. Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT), the owner of Jaguar Land Rover, fell the most in two weeks.  The S&P BSE Sensex (SENSEX) lost 0.7 percent to 22,359.50 at the close in Mumbai, almost erasing a weekly gain. The CNX Nifty index declined 0.6 percent. The Nifty climbed to records for eight straight days through April 2 as international investors extended Asia’s largest stock-market inflows amid cooling inflation, shrinking deficits and a strengthening rupee. India holds a national election starting April 7, with opinion polls indicating the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party will win the most seats, ending the Congress Party’s decade-long rule. “It’s a good sign that market has run up ahead of the elections and there is some healthy correction, which will give an opportunity for more investors to participate,” Vikram Kotak, chief investment officer for equities at Deutsche Asset Management (India) Pvt., which manages $3 billion in assets, said in a Bloomberg TV India interview today. “I am pretty optimistic.”  Election Outlook  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s Congress party may be headed for its worst-ever electoral performance as voters punish the government for a series of graft scandals, Asia’s fastest consumer inflation and slowing growth. The BJP is favored by investors seeking change to revive an economy expanding at the slowest pace in a decade. Results will be announced on May 16.  Asia’s third-biggest economy probably grew 4.7 percent in the year ended March 31, according to a central-bank survey of forecasters published April 1, compared with a decade-low 4.5 percent expansion the previous year. The $1.8 trillion economy is expected to expand 5.5 percent in the current fiscal year that started April 1, according to the survey.  Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan held the benchmark borrowing rate at 8 percent on April 1 after consumer-price inflation eased to a two-year low in February and wholesale-price gains slowed to the least in nine months.  Shrinking Deficits  The current-account deficit will be kept below $40 billion this fiscal year, compared with a record $88 billion in the previous 12 months, and the budget gap will narrow to 4.6 percent of gross domestic product from 4.9 percent, according to Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram.  “This rally is not happening only due to the hope around a political party coming to power,” Kotak said. “Indiaâ€™s economy has bottomed out and that’s contributing.”  Bharat Heavy Electricals tumbled 2.1 percent, extending this week’s loss to 8.3 percent, the most on the Sensex. NTPC declined 2.2 percent, the most since Feb. 28. The S&P BSE India Capital Goods index declined 1.2 percent this week after a 16 percent advance last month.  Tata Motors decreased 1.4 percent, the biggest loss since March 18. Wipro Ltd. (WPRO), the third-biggest software services provider, slid 1.4 percent.  The Sensex has climbed 5.6 percent this year and trades at 14.1 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index’s 10.4 times. The Indian gauge’s valuation was 18 times in November 2010, when the Sensex set its previous high.  “The index is at an all-time high but the valuations are not at an all-time high,” Deutsche Asset’s Kotak said. “Opportunities-wise, there is scarcity in the world and India is one of the very preferred destinations.”  Overseas investors bought a net $187.2 million of Indian shares on April 1 and April 2, extending this year’s purchases to $4.27 billion, the most among eight Asian markets tracked by Bloomberg.",2014-04-04T04:04:39Z,Negative

For the quarter, the index rose 6.35 percent, a second consecutive rise since its 9.9 percent gain in the October-December period.

1246,bhel,"The exchange-traded fund of central public sector enterprises, which faced investor criticism for the way it was structured, will perform well upon listing, claims Sanjiv Shah, chief executive of Goldman Sachs Asset Management (India), the asset management company for the CPSE ETF. In an interview with ET, Shah says ETFs could become a popular disinvestment vehicle in India Edited excerpts. When are you planning to list the CPSE ETF and how do you expect it to perform?  We are targeting the CPSE ETF to be listed on April 4, 2014, subject to completion of prerequisite activities. Given the strong investor demand witnessed in the NFO, we believe the CPSE theme will continue to resonate with investors, and there will be a robust secondary market for the offering. We also believe that this offering will create awareness for equity ETFs in general and usage of equity ETFs for asset allocation in various sectors like banking and infrastructure as well as thematic offerings.  Except for a few gold ETFs, the instrument has not been very successful in India. Will the PSU ETF buck this trend?  We believe that the success of the CPSE ETF indicates that the Indian market is ready for rapid growth of equity ETFs. Investor realisation is increasing that ETFs provide a low-cost, transparent, rules-based structure that can be used for both strategic and tactical portfolio allocation. The CPSE ETF launch has also helped accelerate this trend and introduce ETFs as an instrument to a wider audience. Other factors like reduction in STT on equity ETFs and inclusion of ETFs for the Rajiv Gandhi Tax Savings Scheme will also benefit ETFs.  Do you see disinvestment through ETFs becoming popular?  ETF provides an ability to divest without impacting the price of the underlying shares, as was the case in FPOs, OFS and IPOs. This has also helped the government divest in 10 stocks simultaneously and promote long-term investments by retail investors using the loyalty bonus concept. For investors, it provides an opportunity to invest in well-performing diversified basket. Given these factors, we expect ETFs to become an attractive mode for disinvestment in future.  PSU ETF is likely to reopen for subscription in the next few weeks. How much are you planning to raise through the follow-on offer?  The CPSE ETF provides for a 'tap structure' that will be operational quarterly from July 2014, and which can be used as a mechanism for further disinvestment by the government. The quantum of potential disinvestment in each quarter will be decided by the government.  ONGC, OIL and GAIL together account for over 52% of the index. The energy sector accounts for nearly 60% of the total weightage of the CPSE ETF. Given that PSU stocks are surrounded by worries over earnings growth, production and political interference, would it be wise to invest in them?  The CPSE index was set up based on rules-based criteria, looking at CPSE company returns since 2009. We would not like to predict future returns, as there are always multiple factors impacting stock prices.  Why are stocks such as SAIL and BHEL not part of the fund? Since SAIL / BHEL did not meet the criteria, they were not included. Why would one invest in CPSE ETFs instead of PSU funds, which are actively managed by fund managers and offer a diversified exposure to PSU stocks across sector? The CPSE ETF structure provides several structural advantages such as low cost, ability to benefit from real-time prices as well as the convenience of having the units available in electronic format in investors' demat accounts. These factors will help attract investors into the CPSE ETF.  What are the incentives or assurances CPSE ETFs give to investors?  In the ETF structure, dividends are accumulated by the fund and included in the daily NAV computations, and hence, the benefit is not lost by investors. Also, the ETF has the option of paying out accumulated dividends periodically to investors.  What are the main reasons for the success of the CPSE ETF?  Our belief is the success of any product is a combination of great conceptualisation, seamless execution and effective marketing. In the case of the CPSE ETF, all these factors came together and investors really appreciated some of the product features, in terms of choice of the CPSE basket, the concept of loyalty units and the tap structure. The overall subscription has been to the tune of Rs 4,300 crore, and there is a good mix of international and domestic institutions and retail investors.  We received over 39,000 subscription applications, indicating that the product has been accepted by all categories of investors.",2014-04-02T21:24:58Z,Negative

For the quarter, the index rose 6.35 percent, a second consecutive rise since its 9.9 percent gain in the October-December period. The record-setting rally has been sparked by heavy foreign buying - reaching a provisional $3.2 billion so far this month - as analysts cite expectations the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party would win elections set to conclude by mid-May, given its perception of having a more market-friendly stance. Bets that India's economy will improve on the back of easing inflation have also played a key role.

1254,bhel,"In an interview with ET Now, Hemang Jani, Senior Vice President, Sharekhan, shares his views on the market and some stocks. Excerpts:  ET Now: Do you think the market would now perhaps be getting into a longer consolidation or does it seem like just a one or two-day event?  Hemang Jani: Yes, looks like the momentum is pretty strong. We have seen continued flows coming into the country in a big way and the rupee is definitely a comfort factor for a lot of foreign funds. So, yes, given the fact that we have seen one event pass through, there could be a bit of a consolidation in the banking stocks may be for a day or two, but overall we think that the momentum in the strength of the market is clearly visible. So we might see another 200-300-point kind of an uptick in the Nifty as we approach the election date. ET Now: So you are bullish on the markets because you think the momentum is strong, you are not bullish because valuations are looking attractive?  Hemang Jani: Valuation-wise we would come to know only probably after a quarter or two how things shape up in terms of numbers. We will have the quarterly results coming out in the next probably couple of weeks, but at the moment the way we see the event, there is a strong flow, there is a lot of left out feeling amongst the retail investors and we think that given the under ownership that a lot of investors have towards certain pockets, like private banks, cap goods and some of the midcaps, you would see this uptick for a few more weeks.  ET Now: So what is the sense that you are getting about the places or rather spaces, I should say, which had been running up of late, the likes of capital goods, private banks, is it time to sort of profit book from there?  Hemang Jani: Well, there is some more room on the way up and the event is just over and no negative surprises are there. So given the fact that the momentum is so strong, there could be another 10-15% kind of an upside in the private sector banks. Particularly we like Axis and ICICI, even cap goods stocks like L&T, BHEL. Even in Engineers India we think there is a case for a 10-15% kind of an upmove from current levels.  ET Now: L&T based on Bloomberg and census estimates is now trading at a PE multiple of 23 or 24 times. So at 23-24 times, what is so attractive about L&T?  Hemang Jani: In terms of valuations, if we look at the trailing quarterly numbers or given the fact that we have gone through a lot of pain in the last three-four years, things may not look that great, but the market has to adjust to the fact that there is an under ownership and the fact that if you have some positive news on the election front, then it will dramatically change the entire picture. So there could be a big upside in L&T over the next probably 6 to 12 months' time and after that on a valuation basis it will look much more attractive.  ET Now: So you are of the view that if we get a stable government, the upside for the Indian market could be much more? So, if the election verdict is better, the upside could be more than 10%?  Hemang Jani: Absolutely. There is a clear case of under ownership. There is a visible improvement in certain pockets, though the timing of this revival of the capex cycle can be debated. It may not really happen immediately after the new government forms, but the fact of the matter is that the cyclical downturn has come to an end. So in this three to four-year kind of a bull run, stocks like L&T can give you a big upside. ET Now: What is it that you are recommending to your clients right now in terms of stocks?  Hemang Jani: Clearly, if you look at the pockets, private sector banks and cap goods are favourite. Also, in select PSU stocks, where there is a good upside potential and valuation comfort. Similarly, in stocks like Coal India, BHEL and Engineers India there is definitely a lot of upside possible over the next probably 6 to 12 months. Also, select auto ancillaries like Balkrishna Industries or Motherson Sumi where we have seen some upside. We think that given the fact that the globally things are looking so great for auto companies, there could be a big upside for some of these pockets as well.  ET Now: Give a price target for Engineers India.  Hemang Jani: We are looking at about Rs 275-280 over the next six months for Engineers India.  ",2014-04-01T09:16:01Z,Positive

1260,bhel,"The opening session on Monday started slightly higher over the previous week's closing, considering strong cues from other Asian bourses. Right from the initial trade, we observed immense buying interest among market participants, which resulted in a rally of nearly one-and-a-half per cent on Nifty; the index ended the session at the highest point of the day.   The bulls maintained their optimism for the rest of the week, ignoring unfavourable global developments. In this process, our markets managed to conquer all intermediate resistance levels and closed at the highest point of the week. On a weekly basis, the capital goods, banking, PSU and oil & gas counters propelled the rally; whereas defensive sectors like IT and healthcare trimmed further to close on the losing side.   Sensex and Nifty ended the week with sizable gains of 2.69 per cent and 3.09 per cent, respectively, over the previous week's closing. The '89-day exponential moving average' and the '89-week exponential moving average' are placed at 21,046/6,265 and 19,714/5,903 levels, respectively.  The '20-day exponential moving average' and the '20-week exponential moving average' are placed at 21,761/6,493 and 21,061/6,272 levels, respectively. All the five sessions of the just-concluded week ended in the positive territory as the bulls were unwilling to leave their driving seat. On the first day of the week, Nifty witnessed a breakout from its nine-day-long congestion zone and as expected, moved beyond the 161 per cent Fibonacci retracement level (calculated from 6,355.60 to 5,933.30) of 6,620 to reach the initial target of 6,700.   The optimism was so strong that our market even overlooked the derivative expiry session and gave a genuine up move, barring the last half an hour of the session. Nifty has now closed at a record high and is almost on the verge of confirming a monthly 'Horizontal Line' breakout.   This breakout gives much higher targets and hence, we reiterate that it has become a buy-on-dip market, considering 4-6 months' time horizon. But from a near-term perspective, we continue to mention 6,750-6,800 levels, which are one-and-a-half per cent away from the current level. We may not have a proper trade set in the index and hence, we advise traders to shift their focus on stock-specific moves. On the flip side, 6,643 - 6,575 levels would now act as immediate support levels for the index.  Nifty spot closed at 6,695.90 this week, against a close of 6,494.90 last week. The put-call ratio has decreased from 1.03 to 0.87 level and the annualised cost of carry is positive 6.61%. The Open Interest of Nifty futures decreased by 27 per cent.   PCR-OI has decreased from 1.03 to 0.87 last week. This ratio has mainly decreased due to significant buildup in call options. In call options, huge buildup was seen the 6,700-7,100 range, while in put options significant buildup was seen in the 6,400-6,700 strike range. The maximum build-up is currently accumulated at 6,700 call and 6,400 put of this series.  Total open interest of the market has decreased from Rs 1,74,182 crore to Rs 1,18,964 crore. Stock futures open interest has decreased from Rs 40,034 crore to Rs 35,964 crore. Largecap names which added significant positions last week are PNB, Cairn, Hindalco, Reliance and DLF. On the other hand unwinding was visible in counters like HeroMotoCorp, Tata Motors, Sun Pharma, M&M and Infosys.  The implied volatility (IV) for Nifty has increased from 13.02 per cent to 15.44 per cent. Historical volatility (HV) is at 14.43 per cent and that for Bank Nifty is trading at 28.97 per cent. Liquid counters having very high HV are JP Power, Adani Power, Ashok Leylands,JP Associates and HDIL. Stocks where HV are on lower side are Cairn, ITC, HUL, Dabur and Oracle Financial Services.  Nifty current month futures closed at a premium of 32.75 points against the premium of 66.55 points to its spot. Next month future is trading with premium of 69.45 points. Liquid counters where the cost of carry is high are Unitech, NHPC, HDFC Bank, GMR Infra and IFCI. Stocks with negative cost of carry are Bhel, Ashok Leylands, SAIL, Axis Bank and HCL Tech. When the cost of carry turn negative, the cost of holding a security exceeds the yield earned, thus the investor is losing money.",2014-03-30T23:58:51Z,Negative

1265,bhel,"Like most financial services professionals, the first (absolutely unnecessary) thing we do in the morning lying in bed, is scroll through e-mails and messages. On one such bleary-eyed morning, there were three messages vying for attention. The first was a newswire alert on Facebook acquiring WhatsApp for a whopping $19 billion. It was followed by an overjoyed text message from a batchmate who owns a Silicon Valley start-up that smacked of vindication of her decision of not joining an investment bank from campus. The third from a colleague bemoaning the loss of capital discipline and how everything was a bubble that would come crashing down. Rather than taking sides, what we were amazed by was how a financial transaction had evoked equally strong and opposite reactions from financially knowledgeable people. If there was a universally accepted right way of valuing companies or assets and everyone knew it, why would transactions occur? Well it’s got to do with the untaught “art” part of finance where as our two friends showed, one group of people does things that another group simply cannot comprehend. Professor Aswath Damodaran of Stern School at New York University neatly segregates the two camps into investors and traders—the former believe in value, the latter in price and he cautions that it can be dangerous to think that you can control or even explain how the other side works. Another interesting way of splitting the investing tribes comes from Ben Hunt, the author of Epsilon Theory—those that speak the language of mean reversion and others who speak the language of extrapolation. The mean reversion tribe believes that no variable can deviate for too long from its long-term average reading—be it gross domestic product (GDP) growth or price-to-earnings ratio. So the philosophy then is to buy below long-term average and sell above that number and as one would expect, many members of this tribe are avowed value investors. The extrapolation tribe likes to spot trends early and jump on to the bandwagon fully knowing that what they are buying may look ridiculously expensive on current numbers but mentally they have drawn a straight line or better still, an exponential J-curve for the trend that they have caught on to. Rewind to circa 2006 when the extrapolation trend was at its peak in India. We believed in the inevitable growth of savings, investments and GDP. Every research report we read during that period had “a per capita statistic” of India versus other economies within the first few pages. When you have a billion plus in the denominator and generally a minuscule numerator, justifying the rise and rise of anything from cement consumption to mobile penetration is easy and convincing. Almost every company and sector became a secular growth story in that narrative and if you took the extrapolation sufficiently further out into the future, even the economy became one of the largest in the world. Or consider the newest darlings of extrapolators—quick service restaurants and online shoppers—looking at current valuations it seems that in a few years everybody in India is going to order pizza online. The mean reverters complain that investors who invest in these businesses are off their rockers while the extrapolators urge them to open their minds to the new reality. The jury is still out on who is going to win that debate but we know that there are enough cautionary tales in the histories of both tribes. Going back to the middle of last decade, some of the companies that wore the mantle of secular growth were associated with power generation, software assisted education and micro-irrigation for farms. When the neatly laid out trend of extrapolation faltered for whatever reason (usually hubris), the investments exposed themselves to significant losses. It was like seeing a Bollywood starlet without the make-up and flattering lights. On the other hand, the mean reversion crowd has been calling for poor performance of defensive sectors such as consumer staples and pharmaceuticals and resurrection of beaten down ones such as capital goods for a few years now but the valuations continue to defy their credo of mean reversion. Ownership patterns can reveal which camp a stock is appealing to. Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) owned over 22% of Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd’s (Bhel’s) equity in March 2006 but that number had dwindled to less than 13% by March 2011. The Domestic institutional ownership over the same period had however risen from about 7% to almost 13%. While it is difficult to draw generalizations, the FIIs have looked at Indian stocks from a growth lens while domestic institutions have had a value bent. It’s not difficult to infer that the dominant investment rationale on Bhel today is that of mean reversion and not of extrapolation. As we outlined in one of our earlier essays, the markets resemble a Keynesian beauty contest where guessing what the median opinion would be is more important than your own perception of beauty. While one might be perplexed by things that look ridiculously priced or an outright steal, it is important to bear in mind that there is another group of individuals who might be thinking the exact opposite. The tug-of-war of these two opposing groups will decide which investing style will succeed in markets.",2014-03-16T13:24:03Z,Average

Following the sale, the government still holds a 11.7 percent stake in the bank via SUUTI.""The government's non-controlling interest did not separately factor into our rating of Axis, and the partial sale of it accordingly does not impact our credit analysis of the bank,"" Moody's said in a statement.

""Ahead of FY15 borrowing calendar and RBI monetary policy, the bond market is expected to be cautious and rangebound. The range for the 10-year is seen between 8.76-8.81 percent,"" he added.

The upside in the market has also led the Bank Nifty to move higher with the banking index now running close to 13,000, after an extremely long time.

Increased profit-booking by funds and retail investors at prevailing record levels and a weak trend in the Asian markets, following overnight losses in the US market as investors awaited a key jobs report dampened the trading sentiment.  The 30-share BSE index Sensex was down 77.35 points or 0.34 per cent at 22,431.72 and the 50-share NSE index Nifty was down 20.05 points or 0.3 per cent at 6,716.05  Among BSE sectoral indices, capital goods index was down 1.04 per cent, followed by oil & gas 0.67 per cent and auto 0.59 per cent.

Hindalco, Cipla, Tata Steel, Wipro and SBI were the top five Sensex gainers, while the top five losers were BHEL, GAIL, Bharti Airtel, ONGC and L&T.

US data was mixed, with the services sector showing growth, but employment components showed weakness. The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose more than expected last week.  The Wall Street had ended lower on Thursday as investors turned cautious ahead of Friday's monthly jobs report.

1312,sbi,"NEW DELHI: Fair trade watchdog Competition Commission of India (CCI) has dismissed allegations that public sector lender State Bank of India (SBI) abused its dominant market position by imposing unreasonable and unfair conditions on car loan borrowers.  A complaint filed with CCI had alleged that State Bank of India was abusing its dominant position by not informing car loan borrowers in advance about papers required to be signed for availing a loan and compelling them to sign various standard forms which contained one-sided terms. In an order dated April 2, the Competition Commission of India held that as prima facie SBI did not appear to be in a dominant position in the relevant market (the market for vehicle loans in India) ""the question of abuse of dominant position by it does not arise"".  The Commission noted that vehicle loan market in India is largely competitive with the presence of many big players from public sector banks, private sector banks and foreign banks besides, non-banking finance companies and co-operative banks.  ""In a highly competitive vehicle loan market, the presence of many large players itself indicates existence of enough competitive constraints to the opposite party (SBI) so as to exercise its dominance,"" CCI said.  The complained was filed by one Ashok R Mansata, who is the President of Concern for Citizens, a non-profit voluntary organisation.  According to the complainant, the borrowers of car loans had to sign standard forms in the presence of its officials within its premises.  It was stated that since a copy of the loan documents and forms, to be signed for availing a loan, is not given to the borrowers in advance, it was not possible for them to understand all the papers in front of SBI officials as a result the borrowers had no choice but to agree to the terms and conditions of the bank.  It was also alleged that SBI did not give the borrowers a copy of the documents signed by them.",2014-04-03T12:12:36Z,Average

RGPPL has borrowed around Rs 8,500 crore from various banks, including SBI, ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank and Canara Bank, and has to pay Rs 108 crore every month towards interest. Though RGPPL claims over Rs 1,450 crore from Mahavitaran, the state utility rubbishes the claim saying it does not owe anything to the power producer.  ""Mahavitaran owes us over Rs 1,450 crore which includes power and fixed cost charges. We have to pay Rs 108 crore per month for servicing our loan. But if the state defaults its payment, the project could become an NPA as we will not be able to honour the payments,"" a RGPPL official said on condition of anonymity.  However, in the poll season, the state utility was forced to bail out the producer on March 28 paying Rs 151 crore, which was utilised by RGPPL to make part re-payment to its lenders and thus avoiding a default.  ""We have not made any payments to RGPPL since last August as we do not owe them anything. There is a dispute over some amount, but the Rs 151 crore that we paid to them is an advance given to ensure that the project does not become an NPA,"" a Mahavitaran official told PTI.  To run the project at full capacity, the company needs 8.5 mmscmd gas of which 7.6 mmscmd should come from Reliance, while remaining from ONGC through GAIL. The plant had shut operations since December last year for want of gas.  ""Currently only GAIL has agreed to supply 2.8 mmscmd gas a day. With this, the project can daily generate 600 mw only for the next two months. But now the issue is whether Mahavitaran will buy the power if we generate it, because they are insisting on lowering the cost of power from the current Rs 4.50 to Rs 2.50-2.70 per unit,"" RGPPL official said.  Since gas is very expensive, the company will not be able to sell power at lower tariff as it will have to incur huge losses, he said.  ""Until we have clarity on whether Mahavitaran will buy power, there is no point in generating electricity,"" he said.  Currently, the plant supplies 95 percent of generation to Maharashtra and of the remaining 5 per cent, 2 per cent each is sold to Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu and 1 per cent to Goa.

1327,sbi,"The additional provisioning towards employee benefits by public sector banks (PSBs) will weigh on their earnings in next several quarters. The PSBs have begun the provisioning exercise against an impending wage hike, effective from November 2012. An analysis of 22 PSB earnings for the first nine months of current fiscal shows the employee benefit-related provisioning costs stood at R9,357 crore, constituting 17.37% of total employee costs and affected bank operating profits by 9.70%. While PSBs in the first nine months have charged additional R4,250 crore to income statement towards amortisation related to enhancement in gratuity limit and re-opening of pension option for existing employees (in line with RBI’s February 9, 2011, circular); some banks like SBI have made provision of R1,800 crore towards additional pension liability. PSBs have also made additional provision of nearly R3,300 crore in the nine-month period on ad-hoc basis for wage revision effective November 2012. These banks have unamortised pension liability of R5,250 crore, likely to be fully amortised by most of them in next five quarters. Analysts maintain many PSBs like Bank of India, Canara Bank, PNB and Indian Overseas Bank have not fully started providing for higher pension liability due to change in mortality table assumptions separately. Also many banks like Central Bank, Bank of India, Indian Bank, Corporation Bank and Indian Overseas Bank are provisioning the 10thbipartite wage hike as these banks had assumed 10% wage hike unlike 15% by SBI and PNB. SBI that has seen 34.90% increase in employee costs in these nine months due to R3,500 crore provisions towards additional employee expenses expects further R600 crore of one-time charges in the fourth quarter towards pension liability. “To an extent, R2,400 crore (of pension provisioning) should be sufficient,” said Arundhati Bhattacharya, SBI chairman at the quarterly earnings analyst call on February 17. Aditya Narain, MD & India equity strategist at Citigroup Global Markets, in his banking result review for December quarter wrote while private banks are cyclically offsetting revenue slowdown through costs; PSUs are counter-cyclically (or out of control) offsetting revenue ups with high costs. “While it is difficult to predict the peak in pensions, we believe this is likely to take long and typically happens with the lag of a generation.

Excerpts:  ET Now: The market is poised interestingly. What are you recommending people to do on two key points? One of them is banks. Let us start with banks. What are you telling clients to do considering the rally that we have had? Rahul Shah: I would recommend to go for large players in the banking space. As a theme, bankex will consolidate, stocks will outperform in bankex also. So, SBI is one bank in the PSU pack which should be the winner. Secondly, I recommend ICICI Bank from here onwards in the private space. So get into large banks rather than getting into midcaps. You would see the Nifty at 6700 plus. You definitely will see some kind of profit booking coming at higher levels.  ET Now: So you are recommending initiating a fresh long in SBI and ICICI Bank for current series?  Rahul Shah: Yes, I would recommend a fresh buy also at these levels. I am not negative overall on banks, but I feel that you would see some kind of profit booking in midsize banks, which have run up quite sharply. So you would see some kind of profit booking coming into those stocks and should get into larger banks, which would be much profitable going forward.  ET Now: Pretty soon it is going to be earnings season. From the IT basket, let us talk about front line and midcap IT. Where do you see promise?  Rahul Shah: If you look at IT, the stocks we have been focussed on since the last four to five months have corrected of late. I do not see any surprises in any of the stocks.  Obviously if you look at a couple of conferences held by foreign banks a couple of weeks back, Infy and TCS both had fallen post that. So they have already given the guidance in terms of how those stocks are going to play for it, but I still believe that IT seems to be a better bet from hereon, but not for trading guys. Anyways I still I feel cyclicals will do much better than IT and pharma from here onwards.    ET Now: What bets on metals, particularly the large ones?  Rahul Shah: I would continue to buy metals like Hindalco and Sesa Sterlite. I still feel that there is some steam left in this sector. Yesterday the real estate was up. So I feel that in metals you would see some more buying renewed. A fresh long should definitely be Hindalco and Sesa Sterlite.  ET Now: Maruti's auto sales numbers were subdued in line with what we expected. What is it that you have in terms of expectations for the auto sales numbers?  Rahul Shah: Two wheeler should be a muted one. I feel that TVS Motor in that pack would do well in terms of order numbers, month on month might do well. It would again be a bad month for CV, and obviously there is no surprise for Maruti. Hero and Bajaj both look muted because we believe that your two wheeler numbers will not be great. But TVS could be a surprise. So, TVS would be a better bet from here onwards also. ET Now: Last time one of the stocks that you recommended has not done well, which is HCL Tech. ACC is at life highs. From right now till the end of the currency expiry, if you had to bet on one stock -- large cap or midcap -- which one would it be?  Rahul Shah: Large cap  ET Now: Which one?

RGPPL has borrowed around ?8,500 crore from various banks, including SBI, ICICI Bank, IDBI Bank and Canara Bank, and has to pay ?108 crore every month towards interest.  While RGPPL claims over ?1,450 crore from Mahavitaran, the State utility rubbishes the claim, saying it does not owe anything to the power producer.  “Mahavitaran owes us over Rs 1,450 crore, which includes power and fixed cost charges. We have to pay ?108 crore every month for servicing our loan. But if the State defaults on its payment, the project could become an NPA as we will not be able to honour the payments,” a RGPPL official said on condition of anonymity.  Bailout  In view of the ensuing general elections, the State utility was forced to bail out the producer on March 28 by paying ?151 crore, which was utilised by RGPPL to make part repayment to its lenders, thus avoiding a default.  “We have not made any payments to RGPPL since last August as we do not owe them anything. There is a dispute over some amount, but the ?151 crore that we paid to them is an advance given to ensure that the project does not become an NPA,” a Mahavitaran official told PTI.  To run the project at full capacity, the company needs 8.5 mmscmd gas of which 7.6 mmscmd should come from Reliance, while the remaining from ONGC through GAIL. The plant shut down in December last year for want of gas.  “Currently, only GAIL has agreed to supply 2.8 mmscmd gas a day. With this, the project can generate 600 MW daily only for the next two months. But now the issue is whether Mahavitaran will buy the power if we generate it, because they are insisting on lowering the cost of power from the current ?4.50 to ?2.50-2.70 a unit,” RGPPL official said.  Since the gas price ruling high, the company will not be able to sell power at lower tariff, he said.  Uncertainty  “Until we have clarity on whether Mahavitaran will buy power, there is no point in generating electricity,” he said.  Currently, the plant supplies 95 per cent of generation to Maharashtra and of the remaining 5 per cent, 2 per cent each is sold to Dadra & Nagar Haveli and Daman & Diu and 1 per cent to Goa.",2014-04-02T13:25:22Z,Negative
1332,sbi,"Mumbai, April 1: The Reserve Bank of India today came down heavily on “window dressing’’ by banks to meet performance objectives.  RBI governor Raghuram Rajan today said the apex bank was planning to come out with measures to check such practices.  Rajan said the RBI would not bail out lenders for their policies. “I don’t think the RBI should be in the business of bailing out the banking system with the infusion of liquidity when the system is creating its own problems.”  On the practice of window dressing by lenders at the end of the year, the RBI governor said some of them reduced their risk-weighted assets to lower their capital requirements, while others increased their assets to meet performance targets set by the government. He added that such adjustments affected various market segments, necessitating the RBI’s intervention in terms of the provision of liquidity through the repo window.  Rajan said he would discuss the issue with the lenders with a focus on liquidity distortions towards the end of the year.  “(We should) not come to this pass where banks aren’t lending to each other to maintain the kind of balance sheets they want. The year-end should not be a time for anything special to happen, it should be smooth,” he said.  State Bank view  SBI chairperson Arundhati Bhattacharya today said there was no room for rate cuts now, adding that the RBI has hinted at stability in monetary policy.  However, the RBI today halved the overnight call money borrowing limit to 0.25 of net demand time liabilities and increased the term repo window cap to 0.75 per cent from 0.5 per cent, to contain volatility in the money market.  On the impact of these measures, bankers said there could be a marginal spike in cost of funds.  “We have to calculate the actual cost of funds with this action. Definitely there will be some impact on the cost. But it also depends on which side of the market you are on. However, there can be some cost pressure because of this,” Bhattacharya said.",2014-04-01T21:19:00Z,Average

1334,sbi,"Samsung had launched a very interesting ‘Stay New’ ownership plan back in December. The plan allowed current Samsung owners stay new, by buying back their old devices and letting them buy new ones at low EMIs. It was a good way for Samsung lovers to keep their devices updated and keep moving to the latest models of their devices getting a good amount for their older flagships. The new EMI offer for Samsung’s GALAXY Tab 3 range is equally good. It allows anyone (not just GALAXY owners) to switch over to a GALAXY Tab at unbelievably low EMIs. Samsung lets users pay just Rs 1,334 per month for the Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 and will even offer a cool Rs 3,000 discount in exchange for your old smartphone or tablet. The EMIs drop even lower for the GALAXY Tab 3 Neo with monthly instalments starting at just Rs 725. Buyers can also go in for the scheme via their credit cards from participating banks such as HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Citibank, SBI, Axis Bank, Kotak and Standard Chartered availing an 18 month EMI scheme; but with some added interest rates.  Similar to BlackBerry, Samsung seems to be pushing off their stock piles of GALAXY Tab 3 devices before the Tab 4 range arrives. Still, if this was an inventory flush, one would expect a price cut instead of some really low exchange rates.",2014-04-01T13:12:14Z,Average

IT stocks declined on profit-booking following rise in the rupee value against the dollar which will adversely affect operating profit margins of IT firms in dollar terms as the sector derives a lion's share of revenue from exports.

The upside in the market has also led the Bank Nifty to move higher with the banking index now running close to 13,000, after an extremely long time.

He says India has to live with higher interest rates for now. He adds that high inflation is a key factor for low growth.  As far as the market and the rupee are concerned, they are gaining strength by the day, and according to broad consensus India's macro-economic situation has improved greatly, which in turn is leading to FII inflows.

1338,sbi,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - The BSE Sensex and Nifty hit a record high for a fifth straight session on Friday as state-run lenders such as State Bank of India (SBI) continued their recent rally after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) extended the deadline for implementing Basel III capital-raising rules. Heavy buying by overseas investors also continued to help underpin gains, sending the Nifty to its first weekly gain in three. Overseas funds' net purchases of shares have reached nearly $3 billion so far this month, according to regulatory data. A combination of foreign flows, hopes for a recovery in the domestic economy, and bets that the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, perceived as more business-friendly, will come to power have driven a 6.8 percent gain in the Nifty in 2014 so far. Investors say the RBI's policy review on April 1, where it is widely expected to keeps rates unchanged, and the coming general elections would act as the next key catalysts for markets. ""The outlook remains bullish. The rally would extend itself till the elections are over. RBI may keep rates unchanged,"" said G Chokkalingam, founder of research and fund advisory company Equinomics.

Kaul, however, did not name the ARC buying these bad assets. ""It was a different ARC in the third quarter and a different one this quarter,"" he said.

Other lenders, including Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) and Dena Bank, have also put their bad loans on the block. Kaul also said that UCO Bank's credit quality was unlikely to deteriorate in the current quarter. ""Our NPAs (in January-March) will be lower than in the third quarter,"" he added.

1349,sbi,"When you want to park you money in a fixed deposit (FD), the first thing that you check is the interest rate. But have you noticed that smaller banks usually give higher interest rates on FDs than bigger banks? Here is why. Interest rates on fixed deposits State Bank of India (SBI), the country’s largest lender, gives 9% interest rate on FDs below Rs.1 crore of one-two year tenor. ICICI Bank Ltd, the second largest lender based on total assets as on 30 September 2013, offers 8-9% on term deposit on similar tenor. Bank of Baroda, the third largest bank, gives 9.10% on FDs of tenor of one to six years. Now, let’s see what the smaller banks offer? For a similar period (one year), Lakshmi Vilas Bank Ltd, which comes 38th based on total assets as on 30 September, offers 9.75% interest rate on your FD. If you choose City Union Bank Ltd and Karnataka Bank Ltd, you will earn 9.50%. Why the difference? Analysts say that smaller banks usually find it difficult to source funds. Avenues to raise money such as the money market are expensive for them. Bigger banks have a better command in the certificate of deposit and commercial paper market since they have better credit ratings. Whereas smaller banks have lower bargaining power in these markets. The cost of raising funds through short-term paper is much higher for smaller banks than for larger banks. Hence, they offer higher rates to the retail customers to get deposits. Secondly, smaller banks have a smaller retail base compared with bigger banks and hence they try to attract more customers by offering attractive interest rate on FDs. Which one should you choose? Customer service in terms of number of branches or network can be an issue for smaller bank customers. Unlike banks such as SBI or ICICI Bank, small banks are usually concentrated in specific regions and may not have enough access points or branches, which could be a dampener for customers. In the Indian context, returns on FDs are relatively risk-free—be it with a large bank or a small bank. But you must remember that a maximum of only Rs.1 lakh of an FD is protected by deposit insurance (a protection cover that you get on your deposits in banks).

(L&T) extended a rally after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) left interest rates unchanged and said it did not expect policy tightening in the near-term. The RBI has raised the repo rate by 75 basis points since September to contain high inflation, but analysts had expected the central bank would keep rates steady ahead of general elections and an uncertain economic growth outlook. India’s record-setting share rally has been sparked by heavy foreign buying—reaching a $3.3 billion in March—as analysts cite expectations of a recovery in the domestic economy, and bets that main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), perceived as more business-friendly, will come to power. However, analysts warn momentum could eventually wane, with investors on Tuesday also booking profits in recent outperformers such as banks. Data on Tuesday showed manufacturing activity grew at a slower pace in March as weaker domestic demand dragged on output growth. “We continue to believe that till the election result is clear, index will remain in the sidelines and bulk of the action will be witnessed in mid and small caps,” Vinod Nair, head-fundamental research, Geojit BNP Paribas Financial Services.

It will start production from the fourth quarter of next fiscal,” managing director T.V. Narendran said.  The Odisha project is the second integrated unit of the steel major in India after Jamshedpur, where it recently completed the expansion of capacity to 10 million tonnes (mt) per annum.  The Kalinganagar project, which will essentially produce flat products, will have 3mt per annum capacity in the first phase. This will be doubled in the next phase.  Flat products are mainly used in automobile and consumer durables sectors, the demand for which has not increased on the expected lines in the current fiscal because of subdued economic growth.  Narendran, however, is hopeful of demand picking up next fiscal by at least 6 per cent as the economy is projected to grow 5-7 per cent. “Next year’s GDP forecast is 5-7 per cent. Typically, steel demand grows 1.2-1.3 per cent of the GDP growth. If the GDP growth is 5 per cent, I am expecting demand should grow 6 per cent.”  He said the subdued steel consumption growth was because of poor demand from commercial vehicle and construction segments as they were “struggling”. The construction sector accounts for 60 per cent of India’s steel consumption, while automobiles’ contribute around 15 per cent.  “If you look at it, most of the growth in GDP has ",2014-03-30T20:38:25Z,Positive
1409,tata,"Global markets ended on a weak note in March, on the back of increasing geopolitical tensions, likely increase in US interest rates (from mid-2015) and signs of slowdown in China. US Fed Reserve chairperson Janet Yellen decided to cut the monthly asset bond purchase programme by another $10bn to $55bn per month. While this was expected what ruffled the markets was that the Fed hinted at raising rates by mid of 2015.  On the domestic front, IIP continued to stagnate. On the external front, the trade deficit narrowed further in February 2014, helped by a sharp drop in imports. While the CPI and WPI inflation declined in February, the manufacturing (core) inflation remained resilient and even inched upwards.  Unless manufacturing inflation reverses its trend, the risk of a rate hike remains credible, we opine. However, RBI maintained status quo in its April policy meet. The economic recovery in the US is seen getting further entrenched whereas, growth seems to be slackening in the Chinese economy. In response to this, the Chinese leadership has indicated that, it will announce some stimulus measures. Further stimulus measures are also expected from the ECB when it meets later this week.  Markets will continue to closely watch the developments on the political front. Markets are betting on formation of stable government, which could put the infrastructure and industrial sector back on track. This will provide higher visibility to cyclical/investment-oriented sectors and will also give an upward bias to the current valuations of 15-15.5 times consensus FY15 earnings, we believe. Over the medium-to-long term, initiatives to revitalise infrastructure investment, anchor inflationary expectations and control the ballooning subsidies, will be important pre-requisites for the markets to move up sustainably.  In the near term, we expect the markets to remain volatile. The momentum may continue over this period. We had indicated earlier that apart from defensives, we need to position ourselves to gain from the momentum in the domestic cyclical stocks. We continue to recommend a selective and balanced approach towards sectors. We do like select stocks in sectors like IT, media and private sector banks. However, we also recommend investing in stocks having strong balance sheets and ethical managements in beaten-down 'domestically-oriented' and 'investment-led' sectors. A favourable political outcome will lead to out-performance from these sectors/stocks vis-à-vis the markets. Key risks to our recommendation are political uncertainty, geo-political concerns globally, decline in foreign inflows, sharp currency depreciation and spike in oil prices.  We feel that, at the current levels of about 6,700, the market will remain volatile, but the momentum will likely continue in the short term. This is, of course, based on the assumption that, the election results will be to the markets' liking in the sense that, there will be a stable coalition and reforms process will gain speed. Consequently, this will reduce the concerns on growth over the medium-to-long term. On interest rates, foreign liquidity as well as on growth, markets are seeing positive winds blowing across. Thus, the positive momentum may continue.  The reason for volatility could be the valuations, which are in excess of 15 times-15.5 times FY15 consensus estimates. This is higher than the long-term average over the past 10 years. While valuations are not very expensive, they are not cheap also. Once the important political event is out of the way, markets will start looking at growth and valuations, which may create volatility. The economy may take some time post-elections, to come back on the high growth path.   We had indicated earlier that, apart from defensives, we need to position ourselves to gain from the momentum in the domestic cyclical stocks.

1413,tata,"Mumbai: The GVK group has approached state-run Coal India Ltd to buy equity in its Australian coal mine, JSW Steel Ltd has put the exploration of its African and Indonesian iron ore and coal fields on hold, and the Aditya Birla group is unable to find a buyer for its Australian copper mine. Signs of distress at Indian firms that bought foreign mines during the rally in mineral prices that peaked in 2011-12 have become common. They are looking to get bailed out by other, cash-rich companies, or are waiting for a turnaround in commodity prices to rescue them. Overseas mining bets turned sour because of a drop in the prices of minerals and metals on slower economic growth in India and other parts of Asia in the past two years as global mines overproduced betting on a good Asian demand. Thermal coal prices are at a three-year low of around $75 per tonne and coking coal contracts are being negotiated at a six-year low of around $125 a tonne, Bloomberg data shows. Iron ore prices, too, have slipped from last year’s high of $132 a tonne and are at around $110 per tonne. Base metals such as aluminium and copper are trading at multi-year lows. “Many companies had acquired greenfield assets when commodity prices were high,” said Chirag Shah, director of research at investment bank Barclays Capital. “But exploring these mineral assets doesn’t make sense at the current commodity prices.” There are other problems as well. Several acquired assets in Africa, Australia and Indonesia are in remote locations that need heavy investment in building railways and roads to transport their output, and the companies still haven’t been able to find partners to develop the infrastructure. Policy changes in host nations, delays in securing environmental clearances and opposition from activists, and the companies’ own debt levels have also lessened the hunger for rapid growth overseas. To be sure, the companies that have purchased unexplored blocks overseas are likely to have paid small amounts so they don’t run the risk of having to service big loans, a merchant banker said on condition of anonymity. The top six steel companies Tata Steel Ltd, Steel Authority of India Ltd, JSW Steel Ltd, Essar Steel India Ltd, Jindal Steel and Power Ltd and Bhushan Steel Ltd—most of which have been the frontrunners in asset purchases overseas, were saddled with collective debt of Rs.154,522.6 crore as of 31 March 2013. With difficulties in developing overseas mining assets persisting, GVK?approached Coal India late last year, offering the world’s biggest coal miner a stake in its coal assets in Queensland, Australia, according to three industry people. They did not want to be named. Coal India, which has earmarked Rs.35,000 crore for overseas asset purchase in the next five years, spurned the proposal because of risks related to project implementation, the strengthening Australian dollar, weakening markets and the high cost of production, two of the people said. GVK said the Australian project had a competitive cost structure, a rail and port infrastructure tie-up with Australia’s Aurizon Mines Ltd, quality coal, and approvals at an advanced stage. A GVK spokesperson, in an email response, said that while coal mines may be facing closure globally because of high-cost structures or coal quality, “the medium to long term prospects of coal demand remain strong and this will create a supply shortfall in the coming years”. JSW Steel has put the development of its iron ore and coal blocks in Africa and Indonesia on hold. “We do not intend to sell any assets and they continue to be a part of our strategic portfolio,” said Prashant Jain, head of corporate strategy and development at JSW Steel. “The growth is envisaged on the domestic front. We are targeting domestic steel demand as India will build more infrastructure and more cars.”",2014-03-30T18:51:03Z,Positive

Mr T V Narendran, MD of TATA Steel said that ""There are some issues that are being settled with the state government."" Interacting with the press on the first day of the business year, 2014 to 2015, on Tuesday, Mr Narendran said that the company is committed to the sustainable growth of the town.  Mr Sunil Bhaskaran, deputy vice president (corporate services), who was present at the meet, said that ""We held several parleys with the 3 member secretary level committee of the state government and look forward to settling the issues so that work on the eastern corridor project commences soon.""  Set to come up in a public private partnership mode, the work on the INR 1350 crore road link project, was to be jointly taken up by the state and TATA Steel. The ambitious project, which aims to link the eastern part of the city with the western part through multiple road links and flyover, is held up for the last several years.  Mr Bhaskaran said that the ongoing West Road Corridor Project will be completed by August this year. The western corridor will cover 29.3 km and involve the construction of a flyover connecting the Kharkai bridge in Adityapur with the Mango bridge via the Marine Drive.  Responding to a query, Mr Narendran said that the INR 400 crore TATA Steel International Airport in Gamharia, around 15 kilometer from Jamshedpur, is also on track.  The MD added that taking lessons from the gas-holder explosion incident last year, the company has been extra vigilant with regard to safety in the plant. He said that ""Following that incident, safety experts from our Europe plant and local plant, have jointly scrutinized all important installations in the Jamshedpur plant.""  Amid talks of expansion of the Jamshedpur plant to 10 million tonne per annum capacity, the company has announced to shift few educational institutes that are located close to the plant in Sakchi to a relatively safer place behind Rabindra Bhavan, at a distance of 1.5 kilometer in Sakchi locality itself.

Tata Housing signed an agreement with KEC International to buy 7.3 acres of land parcel in Thane, according to sources. Tata Housing, a real estate arm of Tata group, will build premium homes on the land and expects 1,300 crore (13 billion) revenue from the project, they added. When contacted, Tata Housing spokesperson declined to comment on the land deal. KEC International is global infrastructure engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) major.

However, the company seems to have changed the strategy and has now started buying land outright.   Tata Housing had recently bought a 20 acre land parcel in north Bangalore for a consideration of around 120 crore (1.2 billion) from Alstom and a one acre land parcel at Hailey road in Delhi. Amid slowdown in the real estate market, Tata Housing is utilising this opportunity to buy quality land parcels at marquee locations to increase its presence in the premium and super premium segments across major markets in the country.

It aims to provide relatively small low-cost loans, up to £3,500, to start-ups and businesses that have been trading for up to 18 months.  The initiative has been set up by UK Steel Enterprise, the business support subsidiary of Tata Steel, in response to the loss of steel jobs in west Cumbria.  Peter Taylor, area manger for UK Steel Enterprise, said: “A similar fund on Teesside has helped create hundreds of small businesses and new jobs. We have no doubt that there are just as many talented people in west Cumbria who have sound business ideas and the determination to be successful.”  The fund is open to people of all ages who may want to use redundancy money to set up a business, have always dreamed of being self-employed or want to turn their hobby into a business.  It will provide unsecured loans of up to £3,500 at a low fixed interest rate, re-payable over three years. Businesses involved in manufacturing and most service sectors are eligible with the exception of retail businesses or professional services such as accountants.  In Tees Valley, businesses ranging from a mobile tyre-fitting franchise, fudge manufacturer and motorcycle training centre to IT consultancies, photography, garden maintenance and mobile bar services have benefited.  Mr Taylor said: “The money can be used to help pay for premises, buy equipment, provide a vehicle or anything else that is needed to get the business going.  “One of our aims is to process applications as quickly as possible because we know that delays and excess paperwork can be very frustrating.  “With successful projects often approved within a week, these new small businesses can get up and running with the minimum of delay.”  He added: “We are starting the fund with £50,000.  “The amounts we are talking about may sound small in comparison to the financial packages of up to £750,000 that we offer businesses with major expansion projects, but they are important. It is often a very small amount of finance that is needed to get a new business off the ground but that can prove really difficult to source in the early days of a new venture.”  Since it was set up more than three decades ago, UK Steel Enterprise has invested more than £17m in the north of England, supporting 1,100 businesses and creating an estimated 6,000 jobs.",2014-04-04T10:59:50Z,Positive

1424,tata,"Tata Steel has formed a strategic partnership with the prominent UK research body, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), to develop a range of innovations that will include graphene-coated steels and next-generation sensors that can operate in extreme environments. The research will include studying the viability of coating steel strip with graphene, a one atom thick carbon layer whose properties include anti-corrosion and a high degree of electrical conductivity. Graphene coated steels could boost the energy efficiency of solar panels, or make buildings longer-lasting by reducing damage caused by water or even the most corrosive of chemicals.  Also among the key research areas will be ways to improve waste recycling processes and the development of new sensor equipment whose ability to operate in very high temperatures or extreme chemical environments could lead to greater understanding of metallurgical and chemical properties and processes.  The research partnership with the Engineering & Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) will give Tata Steel access to a wider network of world-class experts, enhancing its research and development activities.  The partners will work together on long-term research, postgraduate training and knowledge exchange in a number of different pre-defined areas.

1426,tata,"Mozambique’s Tax Authority is still pursuing capital gains on the sale of the Benga project to Anglo-Australian mining major Rio Tinto. This was affirmed recently by Tax Authority president Rosário Fernandes at a press conference in Maputo. Strictly speaking, Australian junior mining company Riversdale, which owned 65% of Benga, a coking or metallurgical coal project in Tete province, was sold to Rio Tinto in 2011 for $4.1-billion. (The remaining 35% of the Benga operation belongs to Tata Steel of India.)  Mozambique believes that it is owed at least $200-million in tax on the sale. “The Riversdale operation is not an abandoned subject, because it never can be,” stated Fernandes. “The Riversdale/Rio Tinto transaction is in tax litigation and we expect to have results.  “Tax is an imperative of the law,” he pointed out. “Thus, the issue remains on the table and we are going to take it to the very end.”  (Since acquiring Benga, Rio Tinto has been forced to make massive write-downs on this project, which is now in operation. In January 2013, it announced an impairment of $3-billion on its Mozambique operation and, in January this year, a further write-down of $470-million.)  Overall sales of shares in coal mining and hydrocarbons projects by seven multinational groups in Mozambique are forecast by the Tax Authority to bring in $3-billion in capital gains taxes by the end of this year, assuming the value of the transactions reaches the level expected. Since 2012, Maputo has collected some $1.3-billion in capital gains tax from transactions undertaken by five multinational groups in the country. Examples cited involved US-based Anadarko Petroleum, the operator of Area 1 of the Rovuma Basin offshore gas fields, and Italian group ENI, operator of Rovuma Area 4.  Separately, Mozambique Mineral Resources Minister Esperança Bias has criticised Mozambique companies that acquire mining prospecting licences in the country with the intention of selling them to international investors. This behaviour displayed the lack of capacity of local companies to manage operations. It also damaged the credibility of the prospecting licence bidding process for Mozambican citizens.  “We have complaints from the private sector that the government only awards search licences to foreigners and that there are no opportunities for Mozambicans,” she reported. “We undertook a bidding process in the coal sector, specifically for citizens, but they offered to sell their share to foreigners, as soon as they won the bid.”  Independently, Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (RTCM) has announced that the value of its purchases of goods and services from Mozambique vendors last year came to $295-million. These acquisitions included fuel, staff and coal transport services, catering, consultancy services and office materials, amongst other things. “The company is committed to the development of local business, one of the essential levers for the sustainable development of Mozambique,” affirmed RTCM external relations financial director Pedro Sacadura Botte. Despite its problems, Benga’s coal production rose by 230% last year.  Unrelated news is that UK-domiciled Beacon Hill Resources, owner and operator of Minas Moatize, also in Tete province, has reported that 90 railway wagons, for the transport of coal, have arrived in Mozambique (through the port of Beira) and are expected to enter service shortly. The wagons were manufactured by Transnet Engineering in South Africa. Further, five locomotives from Grindrod, also in South Africa, are expected to be delivered soon.

The Treasury head has announced 22 new Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs) and one of these, a new £7.8m Centre for Structural Integrity & Materials for Offshore Wind and Marine Renewable Energy, will be led by Cranfield and they will partner in a second new centre. The Centre of Renewable Energy Marine Structures (REMS) will train 50 Engineering Doctorate (EngD) students over an eight-year period, admitting ten new students each year for five years starting in October 2014. This is a collaborative partnership between Cranfield University and the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Oxford. The University’s offshore renewable energy engineering activity led by Professor Feargal Brennan has evolved from a sustained world-leading research presence in the offshore oil and gas sector for over 30 years and now covers a spectrum of applications from wave, tidal stream and wind power. Professor Brennan, REMS Centre Director said: “Offshore and Marine Renewable Energy is one of the most exciting areas for talented young mechanical and structural engineers beginning their careers. “The REMS Centre working alongside other national initiatives will ensure the UK leads the world in the development, implementation and cost-effective operation of offshore structures for Wind, Wave and Tidal Power. “Our partnership with Oxford University, who has been at the forefront of academic developments for over thirty years in offshore Geotechnics particularly for foundation design, brings together unprecedented world-class research and training expertise in Offshore and Marine Structures.” REMS other partners include Arup, Atkins, Centrica, DnV, Dong, E.ON, EDF, Fugro, GE, Mojo Maritime, Qinetiq, RES, RWE, Skanska, Tata Steel. Cranfield are also partnering with The University of Warwick in the new EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Sustainable Materials and Manufacturing. It will produce the next generation of manufacturing business leaders with a high level understanding of interdisciplinary enterprise, the research experience essential to compete in a global low carbon environment, and an international view of Sustainability and the Circular Economy. The Centre will address industry-driven research challenges including: establishing natural or recovered materials as feed-stocks, reducing process inputs and outputs without compromising performance or economic viability, extracting high value materials from waste streams, and ultimately establishing economic and environmental sustainability. REMS is the second EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training at Cranfield. The STREAM programme – an Industrial Doctoral Centre for the water sector was awarded funding in January 2014.

It has granted shareholder OMH Ltd's OMS unit exclusive marketing rights in Asia, excluding the Middle East and Commonwealth of Independent States, the Australian Securities Exchange-listed company said in an annual report.  Persian Gulf-based DRI pellet producer and steelmaker Bahrain Steel resumed purchase of concentrate in the second half of last year, taking 120,000 dry mt. Keystone offtaker Tata Steel may take more from Northern Iron under a five-year contract expiring March 2016 and for a minimum 5.2 million mt, primarily for use at the Ijmuiden Pellet Plant. Pricing is based on a current quarter basis since the fourth quarter of 2011.

However, the S&P BSE benchmark declined afterwards to end at 22,359.50 on tail-end profit-booking, still showing a gain of 19.53 points, or 0.09 per cent. However, the NSE 50-share Nifty settled at 6,694.35, a tad lower from the last weekend's level of 6,695.90 after logging a fresh lifetime intra-day high of 6,776.75. Brokers attributed the rally to investor hopes of a stable government after the forthcoming general elections and economy returning to high growth path. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), at its April 1 policy meet, left the short-term lending rate, or repo, unchanged at 8 per cent and cash reserve ratio at 4 per cent.

1503,sunpharma,"(Reuters) - Swedish generic drugmaker Meda AB rejected a takeover approach by U.S. rival Mylan Inc to create a combined company worth around $24 billion. The generic drugs sector has seen a wave of mergers recently as companies selling popular copycat versions of blockbuster medicines have been hit by a dwindling number of patent expirations and are looking to cut costs. Meda said on Friday it had been contacted about an indicative proposal to combine the two businesses but its board had decided to reject the proposal. ""All continued discussions between Meda and Mylan have been terminated without further actions,"" it said in a statement. Shares in Meda closed up 14 percent at 110.6 Swedish crowns valuing the company at 33.4 billion Swedish crowns ($5.1 billion) while Mylan stock rose 4.2 percent to $51.94 by 1627 GMT valuing that firm at $19.3 billion. Media reports said Mylan was exploring a bid at a significant premium. ""Given that this deal makes too much financial sense for both parties, we believe that there is an exceedingly high likelihood that it still will occur,"" analysts at Cowen said in a research note. Mylan, which had already said it wanted to make a big acquisition this year, said it was ""considering a wide range of possible opportunities"", but would not comment further. Meda, which makes specialty products, over-the-counter drugs and branded generics, has long been viewed as a takeover target in a rapidly consolidating generics drug sector where economies of scale are important. If any deal was pitched at a level similar to Actavis's bid for Forest Labs in February, it would imply a 25 percent premium to Meda's share price before the news, giving a $7.9 billion deal value, including Meda's $2.3 billion in debt. Buying Meda would boost Mylan's presence outside the United States and give it access to Meda's distribution channels in Europe and some emerging markets, where Meda has grown quickly in recent years. An acquisition would also boost Mylan's position in specialty pharmaceuticals where it focuses on respiratory and allergy medicines, which is a key area for Meda as well. Of Meda's $2 billion 2013 sales, more than 80 percent were outside the United States. Among potential buyers, Mylan was well placed to make a move, bankers and analysts said. It could also take advantage of lower corporate tax rates as the company's purchase would increase the percentage of revenues coming from overseas, allowing it to move its tax domicile outside of the U.S. Rivals Actavis and Valeant already lowered their tax rates with moves to Ireland. Moreover, bankers noted, Valeant recently bought Bausch & Lomb which it is busy integrating, whereas Actavis' $25 billion acquisition of Forest has not yet closed. A year ago India's Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd held talks to buy Meda for between $5 billion and $6 billion in a bid to boost its generics business in developed markets, sources with knowledge of the matter said at the time. Analysts in Mumbai said they doubted Sun would be interested in buying Meda now, since the talks last year foundered mainly on valuation and Meda's stock price has risen sharply since its $4 billion market valuation at the time. Both Meda and Mylan are valued at around 10 times 2014 forecast earnings before interest, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), including debt, according to Thomson Reuters data. ""Sun has not done any expensive acquisitions. It doesn't look like a valuation number that Sun Pharma is generally comfortable with,"" said Aditya Khemka of Ambit Capital. A Sun Pharma spokesman declined to comment. Meda's biggest owner is Stena Sessan Rederi AB, controlled by the Olsson business family, which owns 22.7 percent of shares meaning it could block any takeover attempt. The generic drugs sector has had a good run in the past decade by selling copycat versions of medicines but as times have got harder, growth and profit margins have come under pressure, with mergers seen as one way to improve efficiencies. Recent deals in the sector have led to savings of about 8 percent of sales, analysts estimate, and Mylan said in February it was open to looking at makers of branded drugs and deals outside of the United States to add to future earnings. The Pennsylvania-based firm, which last year bought Agila, a unit of India's Strides Arcolab Ltd for $1.6 billion, had appointed advisers to help it put together a deal for Meda, people familiar with the matter said. Chief Executive Heather Bresch told analysts in February the company planned a major transaction this year that would add to future earnings.",2014-04-04T07:46:33Z,Average

Perversely a much stronger read might not be so positive for shares since it could reignite speculation of an earlier rate hike from the Federal Reserve.

1510,sunpharma,"Over the past six years, promoters of India's large business groups dependent on government policies have failed to create meaningful value for shareholders, while those in sectors such as consumer goods and pharmaceuticals that don't have as much to do with such an interface have emerged as top value creators, according to an ET Intelligence Group analysis. While the Rahul Bajaj group has been the biggest gainer, DLF has suffered the biggest drop. Promoters of industrial and infrastructure-related businesses, including Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries, Anil Ambani's Reliance Group, KP Singhled DLF and Jaiprakash Gaur-promoted JayPee Group, have seen the erosion of shareholder value in group companies. These promoters suffered an annual compounded loss of 3-25% in the value of group holdings during the period that roughly coincides with the UPA government's second term. The slower pace of economic activity reflected in decadelow GDP growth in the past few quarters, lack of capital expenditure and policy hurdles have severely impacted these business groups. ""Projects have been stuck due to lack of policy initiatives and issues relating to environmental clearances and land acquisition,"" said Sandeep Singal, co-head, institutional equities, Emkay Global Financial Services. On the other hand, promoters of auto and auto ancillary manufacturers, including Bajaj Auto, TVS Motors and Motherson Sumi, and those of pharmaceutical companies such as Dr Reddy's Laboratories, Lupin, Sun Pharma and Zydus Cadila together with Asian Paints and Godrej Consumer are among the biggest beneficiaries in terms of growth in value of holdings in publicly listed group companies. The promoter wealth of these groups grew at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30-59%, reflecting a jump of anywhere between three times and 10 times in their fortunes. The consumption story of the past few years came as a boost to such business. ""Consumer-facing businesses have benefited from inflation. One of the primary characteristics of the inflationary conditions that prevailed from 2009-14 has been the propensity to consume at the altar of savings,"" said Phani Sekhar, fund manager, portfolio management services, Angel Broking. Rahul Bajaj's Bajaj Group, which has interests in automobiles and consumer financing, emerged as the biggest gainer in terms of promoter wealth among the top 30 business houses in India, having risen at a CAGR of 59% to Rs 52,761 crore between FY08 and FY14. The DB Gupta family of Lupin was a close second with a 57% jump to Rs 19,814 crore. In the third place was Zydus Cadila led by Pankaj Patel, up 49% to Rs 17,105 crore. Most of these promoter groups focus on single sectors, said Emkay's Singal. ""These families have a highly concentrated asset style, which helps when things are moving pretty well for a particular sector,"" Singal said. Auto and related businesses benefited from higher consumer demand in urban and rural areas helped by easy credit. The pharma sector, given its export orientation, benefited from a weak rupee during the past five years. The rupee depreciated by over 27% to around 60 against the dollar by the end of FY14 from about 40 at the end of FY08. The aggregate worth of India Inc's top 10 promoter groups touched $200 billion once again after a gap of three years. Between FY08, when the Sensex crossed 20,000 for the first time, and FY14, when it scaled that mark again, the aggregate wealth of the top 10 promoter groups, measured in terms of the market capitalisation of their publicly listed entities, doubled to an all-time high of Rs 11.99 lakh crore, or $200 billion on April 1. This was nearly 17% of the BSE's total market cap of around Rs 73 lakh crore, or $1,211 billion. With a market cap of Rs 4.2 lakh crore, Tata Sons was on top of the list followed by Mukesh Ambani (Rs 1.4 lakh crore), Bharti Airtel promoter group (Rs 1.1 lakh crore) and Wipro's Azim Premji (Rs 1 lakh crore).",2014-04-04T02:17:17Z,Positive

The key barometer finally settled at 22,386.27 points-- setting a fresh closing record for the fourth straight day-- 46.30 points or 0.21 per cent higher than its previous close. The 50-share Nifty recorded its lifetime closing high of 6,704.20, up by 8.30 points from its previous close. It jumped to 6,730.05, all-time intra-trade record high. With foreign fund flows continuing relentlessly, the indices have been setting record life-time high for six days in succession. Brokers attributed the rally to investor hopes of a stable Government after elections and signs of economy returning to high growth path. The Sensex has gained 1,266.15 points in March this year, the best monthly gain since October. For the full fiscal, the key index has witnessed a rise of 3,550.50 points, an increase of 18.8 per cent from closing level on March 28 last year. Expectations that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its annual monetary policy tomorrow will keep the key rates unchanged also buoyed the market sentiment. Investor wealth soared by over Rs 10.27 lakh crore to Rs 74.15 lakh crore during 2013-14 on the back of rising stock prices helped by smart foreign fund inflows. The BSE Sensex gained 3,550.5 points or 18.84 per cent in 2013-14 fiscal. Led by the rally in the stock market, the investor wealth soared by Rs 10,27,424 crore to Rs 74,15,310 crore as on Monday from Rs 63,87,886 crore in the previous fiscal, 2012-13. Brokers have attributed the rally to investor hopes of a stable Government after elections and signs of economy returning to high growth path. Foreign investors, the main drivers of Indian stock markets, have made net inflows of a whopping nearly Rs 80,000 crore in the domestic stocks during the current fiscal year. Marketmen said that sentiment in the stock market picked up following euphoria related to general elections and on hopes that a BJP-led government will come into power in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections starting next month. Analysts expects that the Bharatiya Janata Party would win elections set to conclude by mid-May and this has fuelled rally in the stock market, given the party’s perception of having a more market-friendly stance. Besides, hopes that the country’s economy will improve on the back of easing inflation have also played a key role in stellar market performance, they said. Markets are waiting for the election outcome, which will have a major impact, an expert said. Metal stocks were at the forefront of the rally. Brokers said metal stocks attracted buying on hopes that China will take steps to stimulate sagging economy. The communist country is the world’s largest consumer of copper and aluminium. Hindalco zoomed 8.71 per cent to end the day as the best Sensex gainer of the day. Tata Steel was the next best 3.40 per cent, while SSLT gained 2.76 per cent. “Markets seem to be in a bullish mood and very optimistic of the upcoming RBI policy,” said Rakesh Goyal, Senior Vice President, Bonanza Portfolio. With the inflation and IIP numbers coming under manageable levels, markets are certainly expecting some positive news from RBI policy revies, he added.

1518,sunpharma,"The opening session on Monday started slightly higher over the previous week's closing, considering strong cues from other Asian bourses. Right from the initial trade, we observed immense buying interest among market participants, which resulted in a rally of nearly one-and-a-half per cent on Nifty; the index ended the session at the highest point of the day.  The bulls maintained their optimism for the rest of the week, ignoring unfavourable global developments. In this process, our markets managed to conquer all intermediate resistance levels and closed at the highest point of the week. On a weekly basis, the capital goods, banking, PSU and oil & gas counters propelled the rally; whereas defensive sectors like IT and healthcare
trimmed further to close on the losing side.  Sensex and Nifty ended the week with sizable gains of 2.69 per cent and 3.09 per cent, respectively, over the previous week's closing. The '89-day exponential moving average' and the '89-week exponential moving average' are placed at 21,046/6,265 and 19,714/5,903 levels, respectively. The '20-day exponential moving average' and the '20-week exponential moving average' are placed at 21,761/6,493 and 21,061/6,272 levels, respectively. All the five sessions of the just-concluded week ended in the positive territory as the bulls were unwilling to leave their driving seat. On the first day of the week, Nifty witnessed a breakout from its nine-day-long congestion zone and as expected, moved beyond the 161 per cent Fibonacci retracement level (calculated from 6,355.60 to 5,933.30) of 6,620 to reach the initial target of 6,700.  The optimism was so strong that our market even overlooked the derivative expiry session and gave a genuine up move, barring the last half an hour of the session. Nifty has now closed at a record high and is almost on the verge of confirming a monthly 'Horizontal Line' breakout.  This breakout gives much higher targets and hence, we reiterate that it has become a buy-on-dip market, considering 4-6 months' time horizon. But from a near-term perspective, we continue to mention 6,750-6,800 levels, which are one-and-a-half per cent away from the current level. We may not have a proper trade set in the index and hence, we advise traders to shift their focus on stock-specific moves. On the flip side, 6,643 - 6,575 levels would now act as immediate support levels for the index. Nifty spot closed at 6,695.90 this week, against a close of 6,494.90 last week. The put-call ratio has decreased from 1.03 to 0.87 level and the annualised cost of carry is positive 6.61%. The Open Interest of Nifty futures decreased by 27 per cent.  PCR-OI has decreased from 1.03 to 0.87 last week. This ratio has mainly decreased due to significant buildup in call options. In call options, huge buildup was seen the 6,700-7,100 range, while in put options significant buildup was seen in the 6,400-6,700 strike range. The maximum build-up is currently accumulated at 6,700 call and 6,400 put of this series. Total open interest of the market has decreased from Rs 1,74,182 crore to Rs 1,18,964 crore. Stock futures open interest has decreased from Rs 40,034 crore to Rs 35,964 crore. Largecap names which added significant positions last week are PNB, Cairn, Hindalco, Reliance and DLF. On the other hand unwinding was visible in counters like HeroMotoCorp, Tata Motors, Sun Pharma, M&M and Infosys. The implied volatility (IV) for Nifty has increased from 13.02 per cent to 15.44 per cent. Historical volatility (HV) is at 14.43 per cent and that for Bank Nifty is trading at 28.97 per cent. Liquid counters having very high HV are JP Power, Adani Power, Ashok Leylands,JP Associates and HDIL. Stocks where HV are on lower side are Cairn, ITC, HUL, Dabur and Oracle Financial Services. Nifty current month futures closed at a premium of 32.75 points against the premium of 66.55 points to its spot. Next month future is trading with premium of 69.45 points. Liquid counters where the cost of carry is high are Unitech, NHPC, HDFC Bank, GMR Infra and IFCI. Stocks with negative cost of carry are Bhel, Ashok Leylands, SAIL, Axis Bank and HCL Tech. When the cost of carry turn negative, the cost of holding a security exceeds the yield earned, thus the investor is losing money.",2014-03-30T23:58:51Z,Negative

1522,sunpharma,"MUMBAI (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned imports from Canadian drugmaker Apotex Inc's manufacturing plant in India for not complying with quality standards, the latest in a series of sanctions against medicines produced in India.
Drugs made at the plant, based in Bangalore, will be detained without physical examination because the factory did not meet the FDA's good manufacturing practices, the agency said on its website on Wednesday.
The ban excludes Riluzole, a drug used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly called Lou Gehrig's disease. (http://r.reuters.com/pug23v)
The ban on Apotex's factory comes after manufacturing plants of top Indian drugmakers like Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd (RANB.NS), Wockhardt Ltd (WCKH.NS) and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (SUN.NS) were barred from exporting to the United States due to quality concerns.
The FDA has stepped up scrutiny of medicines made in India, which supplies about 40 percent of generic and over-the-counter drugs to the United States.
FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg in February said the agency was not unduly targeting drug companies in India, but ""undertaking our required regulatory activities"" needed to protect public health in the United States.
Apotex currently makes about 260 generic drugs, or copies of name-brand pharmaceutical products, that are sold in Canada and exported to more than 115 countries. The company's sales exceed C$1 billion a year, according to its website.
Ontario-based Apotex was not available to comment outside of regular business hours and calls to its Bangalore research facility went unanswered.",2014-04-03T07:11:57Z,Negative

Shibulal said on 12 March.“Infosys’s weak 4QFY14 performance due to factors mentioned above will spill over into the early part of FY2015E (estimated). A slow start to the year means the company will underperform the industry on revenue growth in FY2015E. Noting execution challenges, we expect Infosys to adopt an extremely conservative stance with revenue growth guidance of 6-8% for FY2015,” the Kotak analysts said.Most experts believe that volume growth would see a significant acceleration in the June and September quarters.Over the next two quarters, which are seasonally strong quarters, the spending on IT is expected to rise. We expect a sharp recovery in the next couple of quarters particularly for TCS and HCL Technologies,” said Ankur Rudra, an analyst at Ambit Capital Pvt. Ltd.Global IT spending including devices, enterprise software, IT services, telecom services and data centre systems, will increase 3.2% over last year to $3.8 trillion in 2014 as the global economy shows signs of a recovery, technology researcher Gartner Inc. said on Wednesday.“We retain our view that growth will be better in FY15 on: 1) the continuation of strong growth momentum in IMS (infrastructure management services)/Europe; and 2) macro improvements in the US starting to reflect in better demand,” said analysts Ashwin Mehta and Pinku Pappan of Nomura in a note last week.Experts did caution that the recent rupee appreciation could pose a threat to earnings of some companies such as Tech Mahindra and Mindtree.The rupee gained 3.19% (from Rs.61.8 to Rs.59.89) in the March quarter. The margins of IT firms get impacted by 30-50 basis points for every percentage point rise in the rupee.

India, the second biggest consumer of gold after China, last year imposed a record 10 per cent import duty on the metal and said a fifth of all shipments should be re-exported as finished product to help narrow its current account deficit (CAD). But the recent easing of the CAD has given Finance Minister P Chidambaram and the head of the central bank, Raghuram Rajan, the space to consider lifting the restrictions on gold. “I think what we have to do is slowly and steadily take actions to remove some of these curbs,” Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Raghuram Rajan told analysts on Wednesday. Timing of any action will be discussed with the government, he said. Premiums fell 85 per cent to $25 to $30 an ounce to London prices on Wednesday, and industry officials on Thursday said premiums would fall further with any easing of the rules. “Premiums will come back to normal, it may range between $1 to $2 an ounce,” said Bachhraj Bamalwa, director with All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation (GJF). “People who have been on the sidelines due to high premiums will come back into the market.” he mentioned. Bullion prices in India hit a record of $160 an ounce to London prices in December of last year. GJF’s Bamalwa said the government could lower the amount of gold that had to be re-exported to increase supplies in the domestic market. Last month, the RBI allowed five private banks including HDFC Bank and Axis Bank to import the metal, in what many saw as a first step towards an easing of the tough restrictions on gold trading.",2014-04-03T10:39:32Z,Positive

Earlier, during mid-March, the RBI had allowed five domestic private sector banks to import gold as part of easing stringent rules of import. The gold import permissions were being granted to HDFC Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Axis Bank, IndusInd Bank and Yes Bank. According to Haresh Soni, these five banks have wide presence across India. The competition arising out of the entry of new banks may result in state-owned agencies clearing off their stock against orders.

The premiums fell to as low as $25-$30 per troy ounce, a fall of nearly 85% from the peak of $160 during December last year.

While the April—February deficit is pegged at 5.3 per cent of GDP, the final print may be a tad lower due to revenue push and expenditure cuts seen in March, the last month of 2013—14 fiscal year, it said. The official data showed yesterday that the fiscal deficit widened to Rs 5,99,299 crore in the April—February period of FY14, or 114.3 per cent of the target. “While the revenue push in March could result in the FY14 full—year deficit coming in a tad lower at 5—5.1 per cent of GDP,” Citigroup said in a research note, adding that the new government’s budget would be a key factor to watch. Fiscal Deficit in April—February stood at 5.3 per cent of GDP, well above the government’s estimate of 4.6 per cent of GDP stated in the Interim Budget. The increase can largely be attributed to both slower revenue growth and higher expenditure growth. After taking over as Finance Minister in August 2012, Chidambaram had drawn up a financial consolidation road map to lower the fiscal deficit to 4.8 per cent of GDP in 2013—14, 4.2 per cent in 2014—15 and 3.6 per cent in 2015—16.

Under that rule, only six banks and three state-run trading agencies that had facilitated export of gold or jewellery in the past three years were allowed to import. The six banks were mostly state-run lenders. The Reserve Bank of India — the central bank — has now permitted gold imports within prescribed limits by the private banks even though they had not facilitated any exports of metal or jewellery in the past three years. “They have decided upon limits on quantities depending upon the number of (current) customers you have for exports,” said Shekhar Bhandari, executive vice-president of Kotak Mahindra Bank. The Reserve Bank of India did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The move to allow more banks to import gold may raise shipments to about 40 tonnes per month from more than 20 in February, industry officials said. India used to ship in as much 70 tonnes per month, the biggest import after oil that had pushed the current account deficit (CAD) to a record high in the year ended March 2013. “Supplies will be smooth from now and I think premiums will come down,” said Haresh Soni, chairman of the All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation. “This looks like just a beginning to the further easing of 80/20 rule.” India used to be the No. 1 buyer of gold before the levy of a record 10 per cent import tax in stages and other restrictions led to a sharp cut. Premiums hit a record of $160 an ounce in December, triggering smuggling and forcing industry officials to call for a repeal of the curbs. Further major relaxations of the curbs are likely only after a new government is formed around June, officials involved with policy making said.",2014-03-20T07:50:02Z,Positive
1836,axisbank,"The opening session on Monday started slightly higher over the previous week's closing, considering strong cues from other Asian bourses. Right from the initial trade, we observed immense buying interest among market participants, which resulted in a rally of nearly one-and-a-half per cent on Nifty; the index ended the session at the highest point of the day. The bulls maintained their optimism for the rest of the week, ignoring unfavourable global developments. In this process, our markets managed to conquer all intermediate resistance levels and closed at the highest point of the week. On a weekly basis, the capital goods, banking, PSU and oil & gas counters propelled the rally; whereas defensive sectors like IT and healthcare trimmed further to close on the losing side. Sensex and Nifty ended the week with sizable gains of 2.69 per cent and 3.09 per cent, respectively, over the previous week's closing. The '89-day exponential moving average' and the '89-week exponential moving average' are placed at 21,046/6,265 and 19,714/5,903 levels, respectively. The '20-day exponential moving average' and the '20-week exponential moving average' are placed at 21,761/6,493 and 21,061/6,272 levels, respectively. All the five sessions of the just-concluded week ended in the positive territory as the bulls were unwilling to leave their driving seat. On the first day of the week, Nifty witnessed a breakout from its nine-day-long congestion zone and as expected, moved beyond the 161 per cent Fibonacci retracement level (calculated from 6,355.60 to 5,933.30) of 6,620 to reach the initial target of 6,700. The optimism was so strong that our market even overlooked the derivative expiry session and gave a genuine up move, barring the last half an hour of the session. Nifty has now closed at a record high and is almost on the verge of confirming a monthly 'Horizontal Line' breakout. This breakout gives much higher targets and hence, we reiterate that it has become a buy-on-dip market, considering 4-6 months' time horizon. But from a near-term perspective, we continue to mention 6,750-6,800 levels, which are one-and-a-half per cent away from the current level. We may not have a proper trade set in the index and hence, we advise traders to shift their focus on stock-specific moves. On the flip side, 6,643 - 6,575 levels would now act as immediate support levels for the index. Nifty spot closed at 6,695.90 this week, against a close of 6,494.90 last week. The put-call ratio has decreased from 1.03 to 0.87 level and the annualised cost of carry is positive 6.61%. The Open Interest of Nifty futures decreased by 27 per cent. PCR-OI has decreased from 1.03 to 0.87 last week. This ratio has mainly decreased due to significant buildup in call options. In call options, huge buildup was seen the 6,700-7,100 range, while in put options significant buildup was seen in the 6,400-6,700 strike range. The maximum build-up is currently accumulated at 6,700 call and 6,400 put of this series. Total open interest of the market has decreased from Rs 1,74,182 crore to Rs 1,18,964 crore. Stock futures open interest has decreased from Rs 40,034 crore to Rs 35,964 crore. Largecap names which added significant positions last week are PNB, Cairn, Hindalco, Reliance and DLF. On the other hand unwinding was visible in counters like HeroMotoCorp, Tata Motors, Sun Pharma, M&M and Infosys. The implied volatility (IV) for Nifty has increased from 13.02 per cent to 15.44 per cent. Historical volatility (HV) is at 14.43 per cent and that for Bank Nifty is trading at 28.97 per cent. Liquid counters having very high HV are JP Power, Adani Power, Ashok Leylands,JP Associates and HDIL. Stocks where HV are on lower side are Cairn, ITC, HUL, Dabur and Oracle Financial Services. Nifty current month futures closed at a premium of 32.75 points against the premium of 66.55 points to its spot. Next month future is trading with premium of 69.45 points. Liquid counters where the cost of carry is high are Unitech, NHPC, HDFC Bank, GMR Infra and IFCI. Stocks with negative cost of carry are Bhel, Ashok Leylands, SAIL, Axis Bank and HCL Tech. When the cost of carry turn negative, the cost of holding a security exceeds the yield earned, thus the investor is losing money.",2014-03-30T23:58:51Z,Negative

1840,axisbank," Axis Bank today launched Asha Home Loan — a new product targeted at the first-time home buyer in the lower income segment. The country’s third-largest private bank is planning to target the 2.5 crore households who draw income of less than Rs 25,000 per month. At present, the size of the housing finance segment in India is estimated at Rs 7 lakh crore worth of oustandings. But most players tend to focus on customers whose monthly income is above Rs 25,000 per month. Jairam Sridharan, head of consumer lending and payments at Axis Bank, said one of the key attractions of the new product was that it would give loans for amounts as low as Rs 1 lakh and up to Rs 15 lakh in small towns (population less 10 lakh) and up to Rs 25 lakh in larger towns where the population is over 10 lakh. Further, the equated monthly instalment (EMI) will be spread over a period of 30 years, which will put a stress-free repayment burden on the customer. The lender will extend finance for a house of even 325 square feet. Most home loan financiers stipulate that the house size should be at least 600 square feet. The Asha Home Loans product design and structure is the outcome of an extensive research conducted by the bank on the lower income customers in India. These loans are meant for customers with family incomes of Rs 8,000 to Rs 10,000 per month and above. Moreover, the customers can pool their family income instead of depending on an individual. The Asha Home Loan, which is available to both salaried and self-employed individuals, can be taken in both floating and fixed rate options. It also entails simple documentation. While the interest rate for the floating rate home loan has been set at 10.75 per cent, it will be 11.75 per cent for the fixed loan. “We see tremendous potential in the affordable housing segment. Customers with lower income level and aspiring to own their first house in the peripheral areas of tier1 cities or within tier II and III cities has largely remained untapped. Asha Home Loan will help to bridge this gap,” Sridharan said.",2014-04-02T20:13:23Z,Positive

1842,axisbank,"India has allowed five domestic private sector banks to import gold, in what industry officials say could be a significant step towards easing of tough curbs on the metal imposed last year to cut the country's trade deficit. The move could boost gold supplies and bring down premiums for the metal in the world's second-biggest consumer after China. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has allowed gold imports by HDFC Bank (NSI:HDFCBANK.NS - News), Axis Bank (NSI:AXISBANK.NS - News), Kotak Mahindra Bank (NSI:KOTAKBANK.NS - News), IndusInd Bank (NSI:INDUSINDBK) and Yes Bank (NSI:YESBANK.NS - News), officials at the respective banks told Reuters.

India’s broadband penetration is only 2 per cent, while mobile is a vast 72 per cent (893 million subscribers) and rising.

Mobile data ramp up along with an upturn in voice revenue per minute should drive a 5 per cent annual improvement in average revenue per user (ARPU),” it added.

Data will contribute 50 per cent of incremental mobile revenue over FY14-17 (cumulative), boosting EBITDA to a 12 per cent per annum, it said, adding the company’s balance sheet is improving and sector consolidation will be an added opportunity.

Two of the country's top three cellular operators, Bharti Airtel and Idea Cellular, which reported steady growth in RPM during the previous three to four quarters, may post less than a one per cent increase in RPM due to slowing economic growth and increased competition from smaller operators, equity analysts point out. But the total minutes of usage (MoU) on their networks are expected to increase in the range of 2.5-5.3 per cent, as rates remained unchanged during the quarter. In a note on listed telecom companies, Goldman Sachs analyst Sachin Salgaokar says Bharti Airtel's revenue was expected to increase by 4.3 per cent, while the company might report a marginal (around one per cent) decline of revenue from its Africa business. Idea Cellular, the country's third-largest mobile operator by subscriber base, is likely to report a 5.3 per cent increase (quarter on quarter) in revenue, notes Salgaokar. ""We expect a marginal increase of up to 0.5 per cent in RPM, while MoU will rise three-five per cent on a sequential basis. The revenue increase will remain in the low single digits. However, Bharti may have some impact in Africa revenues because of rupee appreciation,"" says Ankita Somani, telecom analyst with Angel Broking.

More Indian companies are improving their high financial leverage and boosting their credit profiles by adopting measures such as sale of equity and assets or using their free operating cash flows to reduce debt, said Standard & Poor's Ratings Services today. The size of the measures taken and our expectation of the impact on a company's financial ratios will determine the improvement on the company's credit profile. ""Besides raising equity and selling non-core assets, Indian companies are also divesting stakes in businesses,"" said Standard & Poor's credit analyst Mehul Sukkawala. ""In our view, the companies' main reasons for improving their financial profiles are the weak economy and high interest rates in India, which have adversely affected cash flows and debt-servicing ability.

1935,bhartiairtel,"CIMB Research has upgraded SingTel to a BUY from a HOLD because it says SingTel's performance is recovering because currencies have stabilised and competition and regulatory risks have been reversed. Growth is expected of the Singapore operations through tiered mobile data plans and fixed broadband adoption. The company has 60% share of the Singapore fibre broadband market. It expects FY15 revenue to be flat. Spectrum will contribute another year of growth but only if there are further cost controls. Advanced Info Services (AIS) is expected to benefit from the 900MHz spectrum auction in the second half of FY14. But this benefit could be larger, if Thailand's National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC) combines the 900MHz with a 1,800MHz spectrum as a packaged auction. And if this spectrum auction is successful, the capex cycle for AIS could be extended by one to two years. Besides benefitting from the auction of spectrum, AIS could grow further by managing capex better, cutting costs and making improvements to service standards. Bharti Airtel is believed to be in the best position to seize opportunities in the Indian data market. It currently covers 77% of the Indian urban population for data through its 3G/LTE service and strategic spectrum investments. It is expected to capture incremental revenue market share of 40% during FY15-FY15, compared to 30% in FY12-FY13, because of higher data revenue market share and higher contributions from mobile data. Growth in India will also come from stable voice tariffs, data business expansion, and greater utilisation of its 3G network. Even bigger rewards could come from spectrum auctions because of unexpected interest in spectrum. Its African operations, through Airtel Africa, are expected to recover through data revenue and the Airtel Money service. Airtel Africa's EBITDA is expected to grow because of higher network utilisation at a compound annual growth rate of 11% over FY14-16. If its tower assets in Africa are sold, there could be more upside to performance. CIMB says Globe Telecom faces a new competitor because Smart, a unit of PLDT, has shifted its focus to the prepaid market. Should this continue, Globe with its focus on postpaid services says it can lower costs. Globe has started to cap data usage to prevent bandwidth abuse and has to look further into data monetisation as a result. It is also exploring ways to bill for data by volume rather than time. Telkomsel is doing well with its leadership in 3G that enables it to compete aggressively and monetise the surge in data usage in Indonesia. Its 30% market penetration is highest among telcos in Indonesia and its core net profit is expected to grow 12%-15% in FY14 and FY15. Re-rating catalysts on SingTel are improving earnings and earnings surprises. CIMB Research now has a BUY call with a price target of S$4.05.",2014-03-28T07:54:51Z,Positive

India's Economic Times said earlier on Friday that Bharti Group was in talks with Carrefour and Aeon to set up a joint venture with one of them after the collapse of a similar venture with the world's largest retailer, Wal-Mart , last year. ""This is not the case,"" an Aeon spokesman told Reuters, when asked about the report. Both Carrefour and Bharti declined to comment. ""Discussions with Carrefour were at an advanced stage. However, the talks were put on hold due to the entry of Japanese retailer Aeon,"" the Indian paper cited one of two sources familiar with the negotiations as saying. ""Some of the senior officials of Bharti Retail are in favour of tying up with the French major as it has an existing footprint in India's cash and carry space that would be a perfect match for Bharti Retail,"" the source added. Bharti - which is also the parent of Bharti Airtel India's biggest mobile phone carrier - and Wal-Mart broke up their six-year-old joint cash and carry venture in October 2013. The move left Bharti to find another deep-pocketed partner to support its retail expansion. Carrefour, which has five cash and carry stores in India, would fold this business unit into a joint venture with Bharti, the Economic Times said. Carrefour would also invest in back-end support and commercial real estate companies owned by Bharti, it added. Commenting on his plans for India at Carrefour's 2013 earnings conference earlier this week, Chief Executive Georges Plassat told investors: ""We are currently thinking about India. We have a small business in India, it does not bring any losses or gains but the true challenge is to know how we tackle India for the next 20 years."" Describing India as ""a very complex, very challenging country"", Plassat said Carrefour would not expand there ""on our own anyway"". Global foreign firms have long been frustrated in their efforts to set up shop in India due to complex and restrictive retail legislation. In late 2012, the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh opened India's $500 billion (298 billion pounds) retail industry to foreign operators, allowing companies such as Wal-Mart and Tesco to own majority stakes in Indian chains for the first time. However, India left it up to individual states to decide whether or not to allow foreign retailers. So far, fewer than half of India's 28 states have adopted the policy, making it harder for retailers to exploit economies of scale by setting up sourcing and cold storage networks that could serve stores in neighbouring states.",2014-03-07T12:23:09Z,Average

This is despite subdued transmission earnings, dent in petchem earnings and moderation in gas trading/marketing. For GSPL, we see marginal sequential bounce back in volumes to 20.5 MMSMCD and stable tariffs.
